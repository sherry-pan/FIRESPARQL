To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined:

1. **Extract entities and properties from the question**: The question mentions "BUCC German-to-English dataset", "F1 score metric", and "best performing model". These are the key entities and properties we are interested in.

2. **Retrieve similar entities or properties from the RDF data dump**: Since the provided RDF data dump does not directly contain information about the "BUCC German-to-English dataset" or "F1 score metric", we will have to rely on the general structure of the data to find relevant entities or properties. The data contains various resources, contributions, venues, and comparisons, but none directly related to the question's specifics.

3. **Calculate cosine similarity scores**: Given the lack of direct relevance, calculating cosine similarity scores between the question's entities/properties and those in the RDF dump would not yield meaningful results without additional context or a method to embed these entities/properties into a vector space for comparison.

However, since we must provide an answer based on the given instructions and the data provided, we will proceed under the assumption that we are to demonstrate the format of the answer rather than calculate actual similarities, which cannot be accurately done with the provided data and question.

Given the constraints and the nature of the task, a hypothetical answer, following the required format but acknowledging the lack of direct relevance, might look like this:

```json
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R76244",
    "label": "Team 2 Subtask 1 English",
    "score": 0.1
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R75430",
    "label": "IBM Journal of Research and Development",
    "score": 0.05
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R75840",
    "label": "Factors influencing evidence-based decision-making in humanitarian response",
    "score": 0.01
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R76324",
    "label": "Subtask 2 in the \"Graded Word Similarity in Context\" SemEval-2020 Shared Task",
    "score": 0.01
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R76971",
    "label": "No specific label provided in the data",
    "score": 0.005
  }
]
```

Please note, the scores provided are arbitrary and used only for demonstration purposes, as the actual calculation of similarity scores based on the provided question and RDF data dump is not feasible without additional context or a method for embedding these entities/properties into a comparable vector space.
