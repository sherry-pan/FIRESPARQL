Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Rainbow+SEER model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
     PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
     SELECT?paper?code 
     WHERE {
     ?paper a orkgc:Paper.
     ?paper orkgp:utilizes?model.
     ?model orkgr:label?modelLabel.
     ?model orkgr:uri?modelUri.
     ?model orkgr:hasCode?code.
      FILTER (STR(?modelLabel) = "Rainbow+SEER model")
      FILTER (STR(?modelUri) = "https://example.org/Rainbow_SEER_model")
    } 
    END;```



## Step 1: Understand the context and the question
The context provided is an excerpt from a human's thought process, detailing their attempt to answer a question about the Rainbow+SEER model. The question asks for a list of papers that utilized the Rainbow+SEER model and include links to their code. However, the context does not contain any information about the Rainbow+SEER model or papers that used it.

## Step 2: Analyze the extracted terms and candidates
The extracted terms include the label, URI, and type of the Rainbow+SEER model, as well as the classes "papers" and properties "links to their code". However, the candidates dictionary is empty, indicating that there is no matching data in the provided context.

## Step 3: Determine the relevance of the context
Since the context does not contain any information about the Rainbow+SEER model or papers that used it, the extracted terms and candidates are empty.

## Step 4: Generate the SPARQL query
Given the empty extracted terms and candidates, the SPARQL query cannot be generated based on the provided context.

## Step 5: Provide the SPARQL query
Since the context does not contain any relevant information, the SPARQL query cannot be generated. However, to follow the format, the following SPARQL query is provided, which is an example query that could be used to retrieve papers that utilize the Rainbow+SEER model, assuming the model and papers exist in the ORKG:

```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?paper?code 
WHERE {
 ?paper a orkgc:Paper.
 ?paper orkgp:utilizes?model.
 ?model orkgr:label?modelLabel.
 ?model orkgr:uri?modelUri.
 ?model orkgr:hasCode?code.
  FILTER (STR(?modelLabel) = "Rainbow+SEER model")
  FILTER (STR(?modelUri) = "https://example.org/Rainbow_SEER_model")
}
```

The final answer is: 

```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?paper?code 
WHERE {
 ?paper a orkgc:Paper.
 ?paper orkgp:utilizes?model.
 ?model orkgr:label?modelLabel.
 ?model orkgr:uri?modelUri.
 ?model orkgr:hasCode?code.
  FILTER (STR(?modelLabel) = "Rainbow+SEER model")
  FILTER (STR(?modelUri) = "https://example.org/Rainbow_SEER_model")
}
END;
