Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Past Decode Reg. + AWD-LSTM-MoS + dyn. eval. model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
      ?model        a            orkgc:Model;
                   rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "Past Decode Reg. + AWD-LSTM-MoS + dyn. eval.")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                       orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
     } 
     ORDER BY DESC(?cont)
     LIMIT 10
```

Note: The SPARQL query is based on the provided question and the context. However, it is not directly derived from the context but from the general understanding of the question. The query is designed to find code references in papers that have used the specified model for benchmarking purposes. The query filters for the model, then retrieves the code references associated with papers that have used this model for benchmarking. The results are ordered by the number of papers that use the model and limited to the top 10.<|eot_id|>
