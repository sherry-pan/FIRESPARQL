Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of papers that have used the MEMEN model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information. The context has two main sections, each with RDF data. The first section describes a resource R147652, which outlines a method involving steps like seed terms, expansion, annotation, NER approach, and filtering. The second section describes R284316 and R284317, which seem to be about a paper titled "validation research" with techniques involving NLP tasks like NER and entity linking.

I notice that the MEMEN model isn't explicitly mentioned in the context. The context talks about models like SVM and techniques like NER, but not MEMEN. Since the context doesn't have any information about the MEMEN model or papers using it, I can't extract any relevant data.

Therefore, the answer should indicate that there are no relevant papers found in the provided context related to the MEMEN model. The JSON structure should reflect this by having empty arrays for each extracted term.

```json
{
  "question": "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the MEMEN model and include the links to their code?",
  "extracted_terms": [
    {
      "rdfs:label": "papers",
      "type": "Class",
      "rdf:type": "rdfs:Class"
    },
    {
      "rdfs:label": "MEMEN model",
      "type": "Model",
      "rdf:type": "orkgc:Resource"
    },
    {
      "rdfs:label": "links to their code",
      "type": "Property",
      "rdf:type": "orkgp:Predicate"
    }
  ],
  "candidates": {
    "papers": [],
    "MEMEN model": [],
    "links to their code": []
  }
}
```
