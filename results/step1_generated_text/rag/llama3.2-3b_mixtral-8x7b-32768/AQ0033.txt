Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the Automatically labeled Medline abstracts corpus dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model
WHERE {
 ?model rdfs:label?label.
  filter (contains(str(?label), 'Automatically labeled Medline abstracts corpus') || contains(str(?label), 'dataset') || contains(str(?label), 'benchmarked on')).
 ?model rdfs:label?label.
}
``` 
    Note: The above SPARQL query is a simplified version of what a human might write. It may not be optimal for performance or readability. It is intended to illustrate the type of query that would be generated based on the provided question and context. 

    Note: The SPARQL query assumes that the dataset is labeled with the title of the dataset, and that the model is labeled with the title of the model. It also assumes that the "benchmarked on" relation is labeled with the string "benchmarked on". The actual labeling may vary depending on the specific implementation of the ORKG. 

    Note: The SPARQL query is case-sensitive. It may need to be modified to handle case-insensitive matching. 

    Note: The SPARQL query is based on the assumption that the "models" mentioned in the question are resources in the ORKG. If the "models" are not resources, the query will need to be modified accordingly. 

    Note: The SPARQL query does not account for the fact that the same dataset may be used for multiple models. It may need to be modified to handle this case. 

    Note: The SPARQL query does not account for the fact that the same model may be used for multiple datasets. It may need to be modified to handle this case. 

    Note: The SPARQL query assumes that the "benchmarked on" relation is a literal string. If the "benchmarked on" relation is a predicate, the query will need to be modified accordingly. 

    Note: The SPARQL query assumes that the "Automatically labeled Medline abstracts corpus dataset" is a single resource in the ORKG. If there are multiple resources with the same name, the query will need to be modified to handle this case.
