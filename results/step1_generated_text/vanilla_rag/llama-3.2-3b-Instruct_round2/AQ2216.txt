Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the LayerNorm HM-LSTM model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?paper?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkg:hasMethod orkg:LayerNorm-HM-LSTM.
      ?paper orkg:hasImplementation?implementation.
      ?implementation orkg:hasCode?code.
      ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark.
       FILTER (CONTAINS(LCASE(?paper), "benchmark"))
     }<|eot_id|>
