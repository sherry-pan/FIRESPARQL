Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the STL-10 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset        a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "STL-10")
        ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
        ?evaluation    orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?benchmark.
        ?cont          orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?evaluation.
        ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
        ?paper         orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?evaluation.
        ?paper         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
     }<|eot_id|>
