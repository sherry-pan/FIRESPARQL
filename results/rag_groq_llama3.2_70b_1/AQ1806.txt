To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined in the query. 

First, we extract the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The question is: "Which model has achieved the highest Top 1 Accuracy score on the ImageNet V2 benchmark dataset?" The entities and properties mentioned in the question are:
- Model
- Top 1 Accuracy score
- ImageNet V2 benchmark dataset

Next, we need to retrieve the top 10 similar entities or properties from the given RDF data dump based on cosine similarity scores. However, the provided RDF data dump does not contain any information about models, Top 1 Accuracy scores, or the ImageNet V2 benchmark dataset. 

Since the provided data does not match the question, we cannot calculate cosine similarity scores or retrieve similar entities or properties. 

However, to follow the required format, we can provide an empty list as the output, indicating that no similar entities or properties were found.

```json
[
]
```

Note that in a real-world scenario, you would need a more comprehensive dataset that includes information about models, accuracy scores, and benchmark datasets to provide a meaningful answer. 

Also, the implementation of the steps, such as calculating cosine similarity scores, would require a programming approach, typically using libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, or scikit-learn for natural language processing and similarity calculations, and RDFlib for handling RDF data. 

Given the constraints of the provided context, the answer is an empty list.
