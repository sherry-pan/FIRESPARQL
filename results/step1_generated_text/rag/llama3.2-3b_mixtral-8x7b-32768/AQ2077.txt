Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the MEMEN model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?paper?code
WHERE {
 ?paper orkg:HAS_PAPER?p1.
 ?p1 orkggp:UTILIZES?p2.
 ?p2 orkgp:UTILIZES orkg:R44243.
 ?paper orkggp:HAS_CODE?code.
}
``` 
    Note: You should not include the prefix declarations in the final output. 
    Also, the outputted query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG, which might differ from the one used in this example. 
    Adjust the query according to the actual structure of the ORKG. 
    You should not include any additional information or comments in the output. 
    

    To generate the correct SPARQL query for the given question, follow these steps:
    1. Identify the key terms in the question and match them with the candidate entities and properties in the context.
    2. Determine the relationships between the key terms and the candidate entities and properties.
    3. Construct a SPARQL query that queries the ORKG for the desired information.
    4. Use the SPARQL query to retrieve the correct answer to the input question.
    5. Adjust the query according to the actual structure of the ORKG, if necessary.
    6. Remove any unnecessary information or comments from the outputted query.
    7. Provide the final SPARQL query as the output. 

    Based on the provided context, we can identify the key terms in the question as follows:
    - MEMEN model
    - papers
    - utilized
    - links to their code
    Based on the context, the candidate entities and properties that can be linked to the key terms are:
    - MEMEN model: orkg:R44243
    - papers: orkggp:HAS_PAPER, orkggp:HAS_PUBLICATION
    - utilized: orkggp:UTILIZES
    - links to their code: orkggp:HAS_CODE
    We can determine the relationships between the key terms and the candidate entities and properties as follows:
    - The MEMEN model is utilized by papers.
    - Papers have links to their code.
    Based on the relationships, we can construct a SPARQL query that queries the ORKG for the desired information as follows:
    ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org
