Question:
What is the name of the top performing model in terms of A2 score when benchmarked on the ANLI test dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a            orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "ANLI test")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
      ?eval           orkgp:HAS_VALUE        ?value;
                      orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?cont         orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval;
                     orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
      ?model      rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
     } ORDER BY DESC(?value) LIMIT 5. 
```

Note: The provided output is a SPARQL query that can be executed on the ORKG to retrieve the top 5 models with the highest A2 scores when benchmarked on the ANLI test dataset.

Here is the corrected code to generate the SPARQL query:

```json
SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a            orkgc:Dataset;
                 rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "ANLI test")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                 orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
 ?eval           orkgp:HAS_VALUE        ?value;
                 orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont         orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval;
                orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
 ?model      rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?value)
LIMIT 5.
```
This query will return the top 5 models with the highest A2 scores when benchmarked on the ANLI test dataset. 

Please note that the output of this query will be a list of models with their corresponding labels, and the list will be sorted in descending order based on the A2 scores. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with.

The final answer is the SPARQL query itself.
