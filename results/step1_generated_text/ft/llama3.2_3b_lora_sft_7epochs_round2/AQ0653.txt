Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the SciCite dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
        ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                    rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "SciCite")
        ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                        orkgp:P32               ?cont.
        ?cont         orkgp:HAS_PAPER        ?paper.
        ?paper      a                orkgc:Paper.
        ?paper      rdfs:label          ?paper_lbl.
     }<|eot_id|>
