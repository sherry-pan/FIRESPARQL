Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the code links in papers that use the BiT-M model in any benchmark?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "BiT-M model" and "papers." The property we're interested in is "code links." So, I'm looking for papers that use the BiT-M model and have associated code links.

Next, I'll look through the provided context to find any mentions of these terms. From the context, I see that there are two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a research method involving steps for named entity recognition, which doesn't seem directly related to the BiT-M model. R284316, on the other hand, is a journal article titled "validation research" and includes a URL "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075" and a DOI "10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075." 

Since the question is about code links in papers using BiT-M, I need to check if any of these resources mention BiT-M. However, scanning through the context, I don't see any explicit mention of "BiT-M" or any code links associated with it. The URLs provided are for the papers themselves, not for code repositories.

Given that, I might need to infer or look for any related terms. The context does mention models like SVM and techniques like NER, but nothing about BiT-M. Therefore, based on the provided data, there are no direct matches for "BiT-M model" or associated code links.

So, the extracted terms would be "BiT-M model," "papers," and "code links." But since there's no relevant data in the context, the candidates for each term would be empty or not applicable.

I should structure the JSON output as specified, grouping the results by the extracted terms. Each term should have its own list of candidates, even if they're empty. The URIs should follow the specified prefixes, and each candidate should include the necessary fields like URI, label, score, type, and RDF type.

In conclusion, the answer will reflect that there are no relevant candidates found in the provided data for the given terms.
