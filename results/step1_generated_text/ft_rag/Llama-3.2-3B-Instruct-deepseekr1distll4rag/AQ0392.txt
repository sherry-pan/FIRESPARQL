Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Penn Treebank")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                 rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
}
```    end of SPARQL Query
```
    The provided SPARQL query retrieves the paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank dataset. However, since the Penn Treebank dataset is not explicitly mentioned in the context, the query does not return any results. The query would only return results if the Penn Treebank dataset was mentioned in the context. 

    To address this, we can modify the query to use a more general term for the dataset, such as `orkgp:HAS_DATASET` with a filter for any dataset label. However, this would not be specific to the Penn Treebank dataset and would return a large number of results. 

    Alternatively, we could use the `orkgp:P31` property to filter for papers that have a more specific class, such as `orkgp:P31` with a filter for `orkgp:P31` with a specific label, such as `orkgp:P31` with a label like "Dataset: Penn Treebank". However, this would also not be specific to the Penn Treebank dataset and would return a large number of results. 

    Therefore, the query as it stands would not return any results, and a more specific query would be needed to retrieve the desired results. 

    Here is a modified query that uses the `orkgp:HAS_DATASET` property with a filter for any dataset label, and also includes a filter for papers that have a more specific class:
```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Penn Treebank" || str(?dataset_lbl) = "Dataset: Penn Treebank")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                 rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
}
```
    This query would return a list of paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank dataset, or on a dataset with a label like "Dataset: Penn Treebank". However, it's still not specific to the Penn Treebank dataset and would return a large number of results. 

    To get more specific results, you would need to add more filters to the query, such as filters for specific labels or properties. For example:
```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Penn Treebank")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                 rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
}
```
    This query would return only the papers that have benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank dataset. However, this query would not return any results if the Penn Treebank dataset is not present in the context. 

    Therefore, the best approach would be to add more context information to the query, such as filters for specific labels or properties, to make it more specific to the Penn Treebank dataset. 

    Here is the final query:
```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Penn Treebank")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                 rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
}
```
    This query would return the paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank dataset. 

    Please note that the above SPARQL query is for illustration purposes only and may need to be modified to suit the actual data and context.
