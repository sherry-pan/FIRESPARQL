Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to answer the question using the provided JSON context. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the Duel hs model and include links to their code. 

First, I need to understand what the JSON contains. It looks like a list of properties from the ORKG knowledge graph, each with a property IRI and a label. My task is to find the most relevant properties that could help answer the question.

The question is about papers, so I should look for properties related to papers, publications, or research. I see properties like "has benchmark", "evaluation", "method", "implementation", and "dataset". These seem relevant because papers often describe methods, implementations, and evaluations.

Next, the question mentions including links to code. I need properties that relate to code or software. "Implementation" and "method" might cover this, as they often involve how something was built or applied, which could include code.

I should also consider if there are properties about datasets since papers might use specific datasets, and sometimes code is linked through dataset implementations. "Has dataset" could be useful here.

Looking through the JSON, I don't see a direct property for "code" or "link", but "implementation" and "method" are the closest. These would help identify how the Duel hs model was applied in the papers.

So, the relevant properties are "has benchmark", "evaluation", "method", "implementation", and "has dataset". Each of these can help in identifying papers that used the model and how they implemented it, potentially leading to code links.

To answer the question about papers using the Duel hs model and their code, the relevant properties from the JSON are:

1. **has benchmark**: Helps identify papers that evaluated the model.
2. **evaluation**: Provides details on how the model was assessed.
3. **method**: Describes the approach or implementation of the model.
4. **implementation**: Details how the model was applied, possibly linking to code.
5. **has dataset**: Indicates datasets used, which might include code references.

These properties collectively help in identifying relevant papers and their implementations.
