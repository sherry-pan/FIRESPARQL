Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question "What are the metrics of evaluation over the OntoNotes dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "metrics of evaluation" and "OntoNotes dataset." The property implied is "evaluated on" since the question is about which metrics are used to evaluate the dataset.

Next, I need to find similar entities or properties in the RDF data. Looking through the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates related to evaluation, datasets, and metrics. For example, there's a resource R147652 which has steps that mention evaluation using a CRF algorithm. Also, R283709 talks about keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition, which are related to metrics.

I should look for any mentions of "OntoNotes" in the data, but I don't see it explicitly. However, there are datasets like "MNIST" mentioned, which is a benchmark dataset. Since OntoNotes is a known dataset, maybe it's not in the provided context, but I can infer that the process of evaluation would be similar to how other datasets are handled here.

For the metrics, terms like "accuracy" or "F1-score" are common, but in the context, I see "93.9" as a value, which might be an accuracy score. Also, the use of CRF algorithms suggests that precision, recall, and F1 might be the metrics used.

Now, I'll map these extracted terms to the RDF data. "OntoNotes dataset" would correspond to a resource similar to "MNIST" or other datasets mentioned. The metrics would relate to evaluation predicates and resources that describe performance metrics.

I need to structure the JSON output correctly, grouping the results by the extracted terms. Each term should have its top candidates with URIs, labels, and types. Since the exact OntoNotes dataset isn't in the context, I'll include the closest matches from the data, like R147652 and R283709, which discuss evaluation steps and metrics.

Finally, I'll ensure that the URIs use the correct prefixes and that each candidate includes the necessary details like URI, label, and type. I'll also make sure that the JSON structure follows the example provided, grouping candidates under each extracted term.
