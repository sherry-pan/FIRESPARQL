Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of 1-of-100 Accuracy metric on the PolyAI Reddit benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
     PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
     PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
     SELECT?model?metric?dataset
     WHERE {
        ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL orkgr:R122689.
        ?metric orkgp:HAS_METRIC?model.
        ?metric orkgp:HAS_VALUE?accuracy.
        ?accuracy orkgp:HAS_VALUE "1/100".
        ?model orkgp:PERFORMED_best?metric.
        ?dataset orkgr:R122689.
     }
     ```


    Note: The actual SPARQL query to be generated will depend on the actual entities and properties in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), which may be different from the ones used in the provided example. The provided example is only a sample and is not intended to be used as the actual query. The actual query will require the correct entities and properties from the ORKG.
