Question:
What models are being evaluated on the Classic dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?classic
    WHERE {
     ?model orkgp:has\_model?m.
     ?m orkgp:has\_evaluation?e.
     ?e orkgr:R122690?c.
     ?model orkgp:has\_dataset?d.
     ?d orkgr:R122690?c.
      }
    END {
```

## Step 1: Understand the input question and context
The input question is "What models are being evaluated on the Classic dataset?" The context provides information about the terms mentioned in the question and candidate entities and properties in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) that can be linked to these terms.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant terms and entities in the context
The relevant terms in the context are "Classic dataset", "models", and "evaluated on". The candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to these terms are:
- "Classic dataset": orkgr:R122690 (a resource and a dataset)
- "models": orkgp:HAS_MODEL (a predicate)
- "evaluated on": orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION (a predicate)

## Step 3: Determine the SPARQL query structure
To find the models being evaluated on the Classic dataset, we need to find the models that have an evaluation and are related to the Classic dataset. We can use the following SPARQL query structure:
```
SELECT?model?classic
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:has_model?m.
 ?m orkgp:has_evaluation?e.
 ?e orkgr:R122690?c.
 ?model orkgp:has_dataset?d.
 ?d orkgr:R122690?c.
}
```
## Step 4: Write the SPARQL query
The final SPARQL query is:
```
SELECT?model?classic
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:has_model?m.
 ?m orkgp:has_evaluation?e.
 ?e orkgr:R122690?c.
 ?model orkgp:has_dataset?d.
 ?d orkgr:R122690?c.
}
```

The final answer is: 
SELECT?model?classic
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:has_model?m.
 ?m orkgp:has_evaluation?e.
 ?e orkgr:R122690?c.
 ?model orkgp:has_dataset?d.
 ?d orkgr:R122690?c.
} END { }<|eot_id|>
