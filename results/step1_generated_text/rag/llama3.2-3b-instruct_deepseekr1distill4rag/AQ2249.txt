Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the SemExp model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>

SELECT?uri?label?score?type?typeLabel
WHERE {
 ?uri orkgc:Resource.
 ?uri orkgc:type?type.
 ?type orkgc:type?typeLabel.
 ?uri orkgr:code_references?codeReferences.
 ?codeReferences orkgc:Resource.
 ?codeReferences orkgr:NER_approach?nerApproach.

  FILTER (max(?score) = 1)
}
```    Note: The `?score` is not used in the SPARQL query. It is used to filter out the resources with the maximum score. If you want to use the score in the SPARQL query, you need to adjust the query accordingly. 

    The `FILTER (max(?score) = 1)` condition in the SPARQL query ensures that only the resource with the maximum score is returned. This is because the `?score` variable is not used in the `WHERE` clause of the query. If you want to use the score in the query, you need to adjust the query accordingly. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the URI, label, score, type, and type label of the resources that match the extracted terms and have the maximum score. 

    The `PREFIX` statements are used to define the prefixes for the URIs and types. In this case, the prefixes are `orkgr:` for the `orkgr` namespace and `orkgc:` for the `orkgc` namespace. 

    The `SELECT` statement is used to specify the variables that should be returned in the query result. In this case, the variables are `?uri`, `?label`, `?score`, `?type`, and `?typeLabel`. 

    The `WHERE` clause is used to specify the conditions under which the query should return a result. In this case, the conditions are that the resource should have the `code_references`, `papers`, or `benchmarking_purposes` property, and the score should be greater than or equal to the maximum score. 

    The `FILTER` statement is used to filter out the resources that do not match the conditions specified in the `WHERE` clause. In this case, the condition is that the maximum score should be equal to 1.
