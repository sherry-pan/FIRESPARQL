Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user is asking for a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs that have performed benchmarks on the STL-10 dataset. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of research papers, their titles, IDs, and any connections to the STL-10 dataset. 

Looking at the context, I see several resources like R147246 and R283709, which are papers. R147246 has authors like Ligia Sierra and others, and it's from 2015. R283709 is a journal article from 2021 with authors Yuanyuan Wu and others. 

Next, I check if any of these papers mention the STL-10 dataset. The context doesn't explicitly mention STL-10, but R283709 is about graph analytics, keyphrase extraction, and named entity recognition. It might be related to datasets, but not specifically STL-10.

Since the context doesn't have direct mentions of STL-10, I can't find exact matches. However, I can suggest that the user might need to look into other resources or expand their search beyond the provided data.

I'll structure the answer to reflect that no direct matches were found but provide the available paper information in case it's useful. I'll make sure to follow the JSON format as specified, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including URIs, labels, and types.
