Question:
What is the top benchmark score and its metric on the Atari 2600 Tennis dataset?

Generated SPARQL:

    The final answer is not a number, but the generated SPARQL query. Please provide the correct answer in the format specified above. 

    Please note that the output is a SPARQL query and not a numerical answer. The query is designed to retrieve the top benchmark score and its metric on the Atari 2600 Tennis dataset from the ORKG. 

    To execute the query, you can use a SPARQL query engine like SPARQLDB or a web-based interface like SPARQL Query Builder. 

    Please note that the output query is based on the provided context and RDF data dump, and it might need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data and its structure. 

    The query is designed to retrieve the top benchmark score and its metric on the Atari 2600 Tennis dataset, but it might not return any results if the dataset is not present in the ORKG or if the metric is not correctly linked to the dataset. 

    The query uses the following predicates and prefixes:

    * orkg:relatedTo: This predicate is used to link the top benchmark score and its metric to the dataset.
    * orkc:dataset: This predicate is used to identify the dataset.
    * orkp:metric: This predicate is used to identify the metric.
    * orkp:score: This predicate is used to identify the score.
    * rdf:type: This predicate is used to identify the type of the resource.
    * rdfs:label: This predicate is used to get the label of the resource.
    * STRLIKE: This function is used to filter the results based on the presence of certain strings.

    Please note that the query is designed to retrieve the top benchmark score and its metric on the Atari 2600 Tennis dataset, but it might need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data and its structure. 

    The query is as follows:
    
    ```sparql

    PREFIX orkp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/predicate/>

    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

    SELECT?s?p?o
    WHERE {
     ?s orkg:relatedTo?o.
      FILTER (STRLIKE (<http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/dataset/> ^?o) && STRLIKE (<http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/metric/> ^?p) && STRLIKE (<http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/score/> ^?o))
