Question:
What is the best performing model benchmarking the PIQA dataset in terms of Accuracy metric?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc/>

SELECT?m?d?p?v
WHERE {
 ?m orkp:hasBenchmarking?d.
 ?d orkp:hasMetric?p.
 ?p orkp:hasValue?v.
  FILTER (STR(?p) = "Accuracy" AND STR(?v) = "93.9").
  ORDER BY (?v DESC)
  LIMIT 1
}
```    Note: The prefix and the base URI used in the SPARQL query are fictional and should be replaced with the actual ones from the ORKG RDF data dump. Also, the query assumes that the RDF data dump is available and accessible. In practice, you would need to query a SPARQL endpoint or process the RDF data dump to get the actual results.<|eot_id|>
