Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the STL-10 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkg:has_benchmark?benchmark.
      ?benchmark orkg:has_dataset "STL-10".
      ?benchmark orkg:has_evaluation?evaluation.
      ?evaluation orkg:has_method?method.
      ?method orkg:has_approach?approach.
      ?approach orkg:has_title?title.
      ?paper orkg:csvw_number?id.
       FILTER (?benchmark IS NOT NULL)
     }<|eot_id|>
