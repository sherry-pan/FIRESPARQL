Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the ObjectNet dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P31?contrib.
      ?contrib orkgp:P32?benchmark.
      ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
       FILTER(REGEX(?dataset, "ObjectNet"))
      ?benchmark orkgp:P43138?paper.
      ?paper rdfs:label?paper_lbl.
     }<|eot_id|>
