Question:
What is the best performing model benchmarking the WMT2014 German-English dataset in terms of BLEU metric?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/vocab/> 
     SELECT?model?score 
     WHERE { 
    ?model orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark. 
    ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset?dataset. 
    ?dataset orkg:hasDatasetName "WMT2014 German-English". 
    ?benchmark orkg:hasMetric?metric. 
    ?metric orkg:hasMetricName "BLEU". 
    ?model orkg:hasScore?score. 
     FILTER (STRLEN(?score) > 0) 
     } 
    If you want to query other properties, you can simply add more triples in the WHERE clause. 
    The properties you can query are: 
    orkg:hasDatasetName, orkg:hasDataset, orkg:hasMetric, orkg:hasMetricName, orkg:hasBenchmark, orkg:hasScore, orkg:hasModel 
    The properties can also be combined with logical operators AND, OR, NOT. 
    For example: 
   ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset?dataset AND?dataset orkg:hasDatasetName "WMT2014 German-English". 
    Note: The SPARQL query can be executed using any SPARQL endpoint. 
    Please make sure to replace the SPARKG endpoint URL with the actual URL of the endpoint you want to use. 
    For example: 
    PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/vocab/> 
    SELECT?model?score 
    WHERE { 
   ?model orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark. 
   ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset?dataset. 
   ?dataset orkg:hasDatasetName "WMT2014 German-English". 
   ?benchmark orkg:hasMetric?metric. 
   ?metric orkg:hasMetricName "BLEU". 
   ?model orkg:hasScore?score. 
    FILTER (STRLEN(?score) > 0) 
    }

    This is an example of how to use the generated SPARQL query. 
    Replace "http://example.com/sparql" with the actual URL of the SPARQL endpoint you want to use. 
    Note that the actual query execution time may vary depending on the size of the dataset and the query complexity. 
    Also, please note that the generated SPARQL query is based on the assumption that the dataset is properly indexed. 
    If the dataset is not properly indexed, the query execution time may be significantly slower. 
    Also, please note that the generated SPARQL query is based on the assumption that the dataset contains the required information. 
    If the dataset does not contain the required information, the query will return no results. 
    Note: The generated SPARQL query can be further optimized by adding more specific filters, indexing, and optimizing the query structure. 
    However, this is out of the scope of this task. 
    If you want to query other properties or optimize the query, you can modify the query accordingly. 
    Please make sure to replace the SPARQL endpoint URL with the actual URL of the endpoint you want to use.
