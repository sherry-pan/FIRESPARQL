Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the AAPD dataset, along with their titles and IDs. 

First, I'll look through the context information. I see two main resources: R147246 and R284317. Both seem to be papers with various properties. 

Looking at R147246, it's associated with the year 2015, volume 6, and several authors. The title isn't directly provided, but the venue is mentioned as HAS_VENUE. The paper's ID is R147246.

Next, R284317 is from 2021, volume 11, and has a DOI link. The title of this paper is "In this work we address the problem of extracting quality entity knowledge from natural language text..." which seems relevant to NLP tasks. The ID here is R284317.

I don't see any direct mention of the AAPD dataset in the context. However, the user is asking about benchmarks on AAPD. Since the context doesn't provide specific information about AAPD, I can't confirm if these papers used it. 

But I can still list the papers found, noting that there's no explicit mention of AAPD. I'll structure the answer to include the papers' details and mention the lack of AAPD benchmarks in the context.

Note: The provided context does not explicitly mention the AAPD dataset or specific benchmarks performed on it. The response is based on the available data and may not fully address the query as the context lacks relevant information.
