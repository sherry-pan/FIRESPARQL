Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the NCBI-disease dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?title?id?dataset 
     WHERE {
    ?contribution rdfs:label?title.
    ?contribution orkggp:hasBenchmarkedModel?benchmarkedModel.
    ?benchmarkedModel orkggp:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
    ?evaluation orkggp:hasDataset?dataset.
    ?contribution orkggc:hasResource?resource.
    ?resource orkggr:isRelatedTo?ncbiDataset.
    ?ncbiDataset orkggc:label?ncbiDatasetLabel.
     FILTER (str(?ncbiDatasetLabel) = "NCBI-disease").
    ?contribution orkggc:hasTitle?id.
     FILTER (str(?title) = "research paper titles and IDs").
     FILTER (str(?id) = "benchmarked models").
     FILTER (str(?dataset) = "NCBI-disease dataset").
     }
    Note: The filter conditions in the WHERE clause are based on the conditions in the question. The conditions are not necessarily the most efficient way to query the database but are based on the provided context. 
    The SPARQL query is not optimized for performance. 

    The query is designed to return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the title, ID, and dataset of a research paper that has benchmarked models on the NCBI-disease dataset. 

    In the context of the ORKG, the query is designed to retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 

    The query is based on the following assumptions:
    - A research paper has a title and ID (orkgc:Contribution).
    - A research paper has benchmarked models (orkgp:HAS_MODEL).
    - A research paper has an evaluation (orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION).
    - A research paper has a dataset (orkgp:HAS_DATASET).
    - A benchmarked model has an evaluation (orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION).
    - An evaluation has a dataset (orkgp:HAS_DATASET).
    - A dataset is related to the NCBI-disease dataset (orkgr:isRelatedTo).
    - A dataset has a label (orkgc:label).
    - A label is a string (rdf:type = "rdf:Label").
    - A contribution has a resource (orkgc:hasResource).
    - A resource is related to the NCBI-disease dataset (orkgr:isRelatedTo).
    - A contribution has a title (orkgc:hasTitle).
    - A title is a string (rdf
