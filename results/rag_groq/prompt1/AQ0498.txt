Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given ORKG RDF data. The question is asking for a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WikiText-2 dataset. 

First, I should look through the provided context to find any mentions of research papers. From the context, I see several resources labeled as "Paper". For example, R211524 is a paper titled "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire". Similarly, R211922 is "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)", and R211327 is another paper, though its title isn't specified here.

Next, I need to check if any of these papers mention the WikiText-2 dataset. However, looking through the context, I don't see any direct references to WikiText-2. The papers seem to focus on topics like named entity recognition and neural modeling, but without explicit mention of the dataset in question.

Since the context doesn't provide information about the WikiText-2 dataset, I can't confirm which papers have benchmarked models on it. Therefore, I can't retrieve any relevant entities or properties from the given data that match the query.

So, the answer is that there are no matching research papers in the provided context that have benchmarked models on the WikiText-2 dataset.

The provided context does not contain any information about research papers that have benchmarked models on the WikiText-2 dataset. Therefore, there are no matching entities or properties to return.
