Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the Oxford-IIIT Pets benchmark dataset. The question is about listing the metrics used, so I should focus on properties related to evaluation, benchmarks, and metrics.

First, I'll look through the JSON properties. I see "evaluation" with the label "evaluation" and IRI "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_EVALUATION". That seems directly related because it's about the evaluation process, which would include metrics.

Next, "method" with IRI "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_METHOD" is relevant because evaluation methods are often tied to the metrics used. It helps in understanding how the evaluation was conducted.

Then, "has benchmark" with IRI "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_BENCHMARK" is important because benchmarks like Oxford-IIIT Pets would be specified here, linking the dataset to its evaluation metrics.

I also notice "Accuracy" with IRI "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71081" and "Recall" with IRI "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71079". These are specific metrics commonly used in model evaluation, so they should be included.

Other metrics like "macro-F1" and "micro-F1" (IRIs P71082 and P71080) are also standard in evaluations, especially for datasets with multiple classes. They measure performance across different classes, which is crucial for benchmarks.

Additionally, "NDCG@10" (P71060) is a ranking metric that might be used if the benchmark involves ranking tasks. It's a specific metric, so it's worth including.

I should make sure each selected property is clearly tied to evaluation metrics or the benchmarking process. This way, the answer covers both general evaluation methods and specific metrics used.

The most relevant properties from the JSON file that could help answer the question about the metrics used to evaluate models on the Oxford-IIIT Pets benchmark dataset are:

```json

    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_EVALUATION",
    "label": "evaluation",
    "reason": "This property is directly related to the evaluation process, which would include the metrics used to assess model performance."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_METHOD",
