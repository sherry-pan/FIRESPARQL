Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to answering the question: "List the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the Penn Treebank (Word Level) dataset?" 

First, I'll break down the question. It's asking for research papers that have benchmarks using a specific dataset, Penn Treebank at the word level. So, I need properties related to benchmarks, datasets, and possibly the papers themselves.

Looking at the JSON, I see properties like "has benchmark" which seems directly relevant because the question is about benchmarks. Then, "has dataset" is important because the benchmark is over a specific dataset. 

I also notice properties like "title" and "id" which would be necessary to list the papers. However, in the provided JSON, I don't see a "title" property, but there's "label" which might serve a similar purpose. Similarly, "id" isn't present, but maybe "property" could be used as an identifier.

Additionally, "evaluation" might be useful because benchmarks are often part of the evaluation process in research papers. 

So, the relevant properties would be "has benchmark", "has dataset", "evaluation", and "label". These should help in identifying the papers that use the Penn Treebank dataset for their benchmarks.
