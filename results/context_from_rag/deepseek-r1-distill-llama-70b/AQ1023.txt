Okay, so I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the MUTAG dataset. The question is asking about the metrics used, so I'm thinking about what metrics are common in model evaluation. 

Looking at the JSON, I see properties like "Accuracy", "Recall", "macro-F1", "micro-F1". These are all standard evaluation metrics. Accuracy measures overall correctness, Recall is about correctly identifying all instances, and F1 scores (both macro and micro) give a balanced view between precision and recall. These are definitely relevant.

Then there's "hasEvaluation" which seems directly related because it's about evaluations in general. It might link to specific evaluation details. "evaluation" is another property that's clearly about assessments, so that fits too.

I also notice "Avg Entity" and "Avg Concept". These might be used in the dataset to describe characteristics, which could be part of the evaluation process, maybe in explaining the model's performance in different aspects.

"Knowledge used" could be relevant if the evaluation involves assessing how well the model uses certain knowledge, which might be part of the metrics.

"method" is a bit broad, but in the context of evaluation, it could refer to the methods used to assess the model, so it's worth including.

I think these properties cover the necessary aspects for evaluating models on the MUTAG dataset. They provide both specific metrics and broader evaluation contexts.

Here is the list of relevant properties from the JSON file that could help answer the question about the metrics used to evaluate models on the MUTAG dataset:
