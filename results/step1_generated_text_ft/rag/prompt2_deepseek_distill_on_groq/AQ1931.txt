Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the Switch Transformer model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information to find any mentions of the Switch Transformer model. Scanning the context, I see that there are two main resources: R147652 and R284316. 

Looking at R147652, it describes a method involving steps for named entity recognition. It mentions using a CRF algorithm and terms like SVM and MNIST. There's no mention of the Switch Transformer here.

Next, I check R284316. This resource is about a journal article titled "validation research" and discusses techniques for extracting entity knowledge using models like Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL. It also mentions datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP. However, there's no specific mention of the Switch Transformer model here either.

Since neither of the resources in the context mention the Switch Transformer, I can't extract any relevant papers or code links from the provided data. Therefore, the candidates list for the Switch Transformer model and code links will be empty.

The context provided does not contain any information related to the Switch Transformer model or papers that utilize it. Therefore, no candidates can be extracted from the given data.
