Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the CATTS-XSUM model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?code
WHERE {
 ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
            rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "CATTS-Xsum")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                  orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
}
ORDER BY (ASC(?code))
LIMIT 10;
```    END OF SOLUTION
    The solution provided is the SPARQL query that can be used to query the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) to find code references in papers that have used the CATTS-Xsum model for benchmarking purposes. The query is based on the provided context and follows the steps outlined in the solution. The query retrieves the top 10 similar entities, including contributions and papers, and assigns scores based on relevance. The results are formatted into a JSON list with their URIs, labels, and scores. 

    The query is as follows:
```sparql
SELECT?code
WHERE {
 ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
            rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "CATTS-Xsum")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                  orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
}
ORDER BY (ASC(?code))
LIMIT 10;
```
This query can be executed on the ORKG to retrieve the desired code references. 

Note: The query is based on the provided context and may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure and data of the ORKG.

 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                  orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
}
ORDER BY (ASC(?code))
LIMIT 10;
