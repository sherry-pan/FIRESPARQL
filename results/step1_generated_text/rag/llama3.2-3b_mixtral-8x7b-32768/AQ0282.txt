Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the Atari 2600 Space Invaders dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>

SELECT?model?dataset 
WHERE {
 ?model orkg:has_model?m. 
 ?m orkgp:has_benchmark?b. 
 ?b orkgp:has_dataset?dataset. 
  FILTER (str(?dataset) = "Atari 2600 Space Invaders").
}
``` 
    Note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG. This query is based on the provided context.
