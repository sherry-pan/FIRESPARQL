To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined in the query. 

First, we extract the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The question is about metrics used to evaluate models on the TDM Tagged Corpus dataset. The key entities and properties here are "metrics," "evaluate," "models," and "TDM Tagged Corpus dataset."

Next, we need to retrieve similar entities or properties from the given RDF data dump based on cosine similarity scores. Since the provided data dump is in Turtle format, we would typically parse this data to extract entities and their labels, then calculate the cosine similarity between the question's entities/properties and those in the data dump.

However, given the constraints of this task and without direct access to computational tools or the ability to execute code, we'll proceed conceptually. We would calculate the cosine similarity between the vector representation of the question and each entity/property in the RDF data dump. This involves converting text into numerical vectors (using techniques like word embeddings) and then computing the cosine similarity between these vectors.

Given the nature of the question and the typical content of RDF data dumps, we might expect entities related to "evaluation," "metrics," "models," and "datasets" to have high similarity scores. 

Since the actual computation of cosine similarity and the extraction of specific entities/properties from the RDF data dump cannot be performed in this response, let's simulate the outcome based on the information provided in the context:

Assuming we've identified relevant entities and computed their similarity scores, the top 5 similar entities or properties might look something like this in JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R212134",
    "label": "Evaluation",
    "score": 0.85
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524",
    "label": "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire",
    "score": 0.78
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211922",
    "label": "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)",
    "score": 0.72
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R75840",
    "label": "Factors influencing evidence-based decision-making in humanitarian response",
    "score": 0.69
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211327",
    "label": "Component for template R206311",
    "score": 0.65
  }
]
```

This response simulates the outcome of the task by selecting entities from the provided context that seem related to the question about metrics for evaluating models on a specific dataset. The actual entities and scores would depend on the specific computation of cosine similarity between the question and the entities/properties in the RDF data dump.
