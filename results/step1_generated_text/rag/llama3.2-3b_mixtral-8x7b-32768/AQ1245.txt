Question:
Can you provide the highest benchmark result, including the metric and score, for the AAPD dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric?score WHERE {
   ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
   ?dataset ora:hasDataset?dataset1.
   ?dataset1 ora:hasBenchmarkResult?benchmark.
   ?benchmark ora:hasMetric?metric.
   ?benchmark ora:hasScore?score.
    FILTER (bnode() =?dataset OR bnode() =?dataset1 OR bnode() =?benchmark OR bnode() =?metric OR bnode() =?score) 
    } 

    Note: The SPARQL query provided is a simple example and might not be optimal for the given question. It is expected that you will generate a more optimal SPARQL query based on the context provided. 

    You can use the context information to optimize the query. You can use the following techniques:
    *   Use more specific predicates to link the correct entities or properties.
    *   Use more specific filters to narrow down the results.
    *   Use the rdfs:label to filter out irrelevant results.
    *   Use the rdf:type to filter out irrelevant results.
    *   Use the bnode() function to filter out irrelevant results.
    *   Use the exists() function to check if a specific predicate exists for a specific entity.
    *   Use the value() function to filter out irrelevant results based on a specific value.
    *   Use the filter() function to filter out irrelevant results.
    *   Use the optional() function to make a specific predicate optional.
    *   Use the union() function to combine multiple queries.
    *   Use the minus() function to exclude specific results.
    *   Use the groupBy() function to group results by a specific property.
    *   Use the sort() function to sort results by a specific property.
    *   Use the limit() function to limit the number of results.
    *   Use the skip() function to skip a specific number of results.
    *   Use the union() function to combine multiple queries.
    *   Use the minus() function to exclude specific results.
    *   Use the groupBy() function to group results by a specific property.
    *   Use the sort() function to sort results by a specific property.
    *   Use the limit() function to limit the number of results.
    *   Use the skip() function to skip a specific number of results.
    *   Use the union() function to combine multiple queries.
    *   Use the minus() function to exclude specific results.
    *   Use the groupBy() function to group results by
