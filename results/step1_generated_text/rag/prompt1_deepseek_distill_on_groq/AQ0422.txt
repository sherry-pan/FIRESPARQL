Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given context. The query is asking for a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WMT2016 English-Romanian dataset. 

First, I should look through the provided context to find any mentions of research papers. The context has several entries with URIs like http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524, R211922, etc., each labeled as a Paper. 

Looking at R211524, the label is "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire." That seems related to NLP tasks, specifically named entity recognition, but I'm not sure if it's about machine translation or the WMT dataset.

Next, R211922 is labeled "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)." Again, this seems more about named entities and morphology, not specifically machine translation or the WMT dataset.

I don't see any other papers in the context that mention WMT2016 or English-Romanian datasets. The other entries are about evaluations, components, or deleted resources, which don't seem relevant.

Since the context doesn't provide any information about the WMT2016 dataset or benchmarking on it, I can't retrieve any relevant papers from the given data. Therefore, the top similar entities based on the question are the two papers mentioned, even though they might not directly relate to the WMT dataset.

To answer the query, we need to retrieve research papers that have benchmarked models on the WMT2016 English-Romanian dataset. However, the provided context does not contain any information about the WMT2016 dataset or benchmarking on it. Therefore, no relevant papers can be retrieved from the given data.
