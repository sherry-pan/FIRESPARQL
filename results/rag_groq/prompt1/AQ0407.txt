Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the query based on the given context. The query is asking for a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the SciERC dataset. 

First, I should look through the provided ORKG RDF data to find any mentions of research papers. From the context, I see several resources labeled as "Paper". For example, there's R162991 titled "Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study" and R175046 titled "Open access, readership, citations: a randomized controlled trial of scientific journal publishing". There's also R175044 titled "Does open access lead to increased readership and citations? A randomized controlled trial of articles published in APS journals".

Next, I need to check if any of these papers mention benchmarking on the SciERC dataset. However, looking through the context, I don't see any explicit mentions of the SciERC dataset. The papers seem to be about topics like named entity recognition, open access, and readership, but not specifically about benchmarking on SciERC.

Since the context doesn't provide information about the SciERC dataset, I can't find any relevant papers from the given data. Therefore, the result is an empty list.
