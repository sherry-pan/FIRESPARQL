Question:
What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the Birdsnap dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric?value 
     WHERE {
       ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
       ?dataset ora:hasDataset?birdsnap.
       ?birdsnap ora:hasBenchmarkResult?result.
       ?result ora:hasMetric?metric.
       ?result ora:hasValue?value.
        FILTER (str(?metric) = "accuracy" OR str(?metric) = "f1-score" OR str(?metric) = "f1" )
        FILTER (str(?value) = "0.999" )
        BIND (str(?metric) AS?metricLabel)
        BIND (str(?value) ) AS?valueLabel
    }
    Note that the SPARQL query is not correct and needs to be corrected to match the actual structure of the ORKG and the answer to the input question.
    Assume that the SPARSQL query is correct. 

    What is the correct SPARQL query for the given input question and context?
    To achieve this, you can follow these steps:
    1. Analyze the context provided to identify the key entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    2. Use the extracted terms to identify the relevant predicates in the ORKG that can be used to link the entities and properties in the question.
    3. Construct the SPARQL query based on the identified entities, properties, and predicates.
    4. Filter the results to only include the highest benchmark result for the specified metric.

    Based on the context provided, the key entities and properties mentioned in the question are:
    - Birdsnap dataset
    - Highest benchmark result
    - Metric
    - Value

    The relevant predicates in the ORKG that can be used to link the entities and properties in the question are:
    - hasDataset
    - hasBenchmarkResult
    - hasMetric
    - hasValue

    Based on the analysis, the correct SPARQL query can be constructed as follows:
    SELECT?metric?value 
    WHERE {
       ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
       ?dataset ora:hasDataset?birdsnap.
       ?birdsnap ora:hasBenchmarkResult?result.
       ?result ora:hasMetric?metric.
       ?result ora:hasValue?value.
       ?result ora:hasMetric?metric.
        FILTER (?metric = "accuracy" OR?metric = "f1-score" OR?metric = "f1" )
        FILTER (?value = "0.999" )
        BIND (str(?metric) AS?metricLabel)
        BIND (str(?
