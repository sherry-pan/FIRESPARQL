Question:
What is the best performing model benchmarking the WMT2016 English-Russian dataset in terms of BLEU score metric?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset?metric
WHERE {
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset ora:benchmarkedBy?model.
 ?model a ora:Model.
 ?model ora:evaluatedBy?metric.
  FILTER (bc:score(?metric) >= 0.85).
  FILTER (bc:score(?metric) >= 0.88).
  FILTER (bc:score(?dataset) <= 0.85).
  FILTER (bc:score(?dataset) <= 0.88).
 ?dataset ora:dataset?wmt_dataset.
 ?dataset ora:dataset?english_dataset.
 ?dataset ora:dataset?russian_dataset.
 ?dataset ora:dataset?english_russian_dataset.
 ?wmt_dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?english_dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?russian_dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?english_russian_dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?metric ora:metric?bleu_metric.
 ?model ora:metric?bleu_metric.
 ?dataset ora:metric?bleu_metric.
 ?bleu_metric ora:metric?bleu_score.
 ?model ora:metric?bleu_score.
 ?dataset ora:metric?bleu_score.
  BIND (str(?model) AS?model_label).
  BIND (str(?dataset) AS?dataset_label).
  BIND (str(?metric) AS?metric_label).
}
``` 
    Note: The `bc:score` function is assumed to be a built-in function in the ORKG, which calculates the similarity between two RDF terms. The `ora:` prefix is also assumed to be a predefined prefix for the ORKG RDF data. The `str()` function is used to convert the RDF terms to strings. 

    The final answer is the output SPARQL query. 

    Please note that this is a hypothetical scenario and the actual SPARQL query might need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data and the specific requirements of the task. 

    Also, please note that the `bc:score` function is not a real function and is assumed to be a placeholder for a custom function that calculates the similarity between RDF terms.
