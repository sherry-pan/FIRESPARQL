Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Dmlab-30 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:hasDataset?dataset.
    ?dataset orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:hasTitle?title.
    ?benchmark orkg:hasNumber?id.
     FILTER (strLike(STR(?dataset), "Dmlab-30")).
     }<|eot_id|>
