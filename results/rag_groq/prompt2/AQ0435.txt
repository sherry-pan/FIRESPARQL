Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a bench for the ImageNet 64x64 dataset?" First, I should break down the question to understand what's being asked. The user is looking for research papers that have a benchmark (I think they meant "benchmark" instead of "bench") related to the ImageNet 64x64 dataset. 

So, the key terms here are "research papers," "benchmark," and "ImageNet 64x64 dataset." I need to extract these terms from the question. 

Looking at the provided context, I see that there are two main resources mentioned: R147246 and R284316. Both seem to be research papers with various properties. 

For R147246, the properties include the year 2015, volume 6, and several authors. The title isn't directly provided, but it's mentioned as part of the resource. Similarly, R284316 is another paper with a detailed abstract that talks about extracting entity knowledge from text and mentions datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP. It also has a DOI link and a publication year of 2021.

I need to check if either of these papers mentions the ImageNet 64x64 dataset or a benchmark related to it. From the context, R284316's abstract discusses various datasets but doesn't specifically mention ImageNet 64x64. R147246's information is more about the authors and publication details without mentioning specific datasets.

Since neither paper explicitly mentions ImageNet 64x64, I might have to infer based on the context. However, without explicit mentions, it's challenging. But since the user is asking for titles and IDs, I can assume that these two resources are the closest matches, even if they don't perfectly align with the dataset in question.

So, I'll structure the answer to include these two papers, noting that while they don't directly reference ImageNet 64x64, they are related to benchmarks and datasets in general. I'll include their titles, IDs, and scores based on their relevance.
