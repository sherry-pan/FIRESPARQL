Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the DY-MobileNetV3-Small model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?code?codeLink
WHERE {
 ?paper orkg:utilized?utilized.
 ?paper orkg:hasPaper?hasPaper.
 ?hasPaper orkg:hasCode?code.
 ?code orkg:hasLink?codeLink.
  FILTER (str(?code) = "DY-MobileNetV3-Small")
}
```

    Note: The above SPARQL query is already optimized for the provided context. It directly targets the required entities and properties in the ORKG, ensuring that the query efficiently retrieves the desired information.

    The provided SPARQL query uses the following logical steps to achieve the desired result:

    1.  It first retrieves all papers that have utilized the DY-MobileNetV3-Small model by using the `orkg:utilized` predicate to link to the `orkg:hasPaper` predicate, which in turn links to the `orkg:hasCode` predicate to get the code.
    2.  It filters the results to only include papers that have utilized the DY-MobileNetV3-Small model by checking if the code is equal to "DY-MobileNetV3-Small".

    The query returns the paper, code, and code link for each paper that has utilized the DY-MobileNetV3-Small model and has a code, providing the desired output.<|eot_id|>
