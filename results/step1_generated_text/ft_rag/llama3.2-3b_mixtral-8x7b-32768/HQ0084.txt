Question:
What is the emergency type of AMBER Alert?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?emergency_type
     WHERE {
    ?model        a            orkgc:Model;
                  rdfs:label      ?model_lbl.
     FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "AMBER Alert")
    ?model orkgp:P31?class.
    ?class rdfs:label      ?emergency_type_lbl.
     FILTER (str(?emergency_type_lbl) = "captures the meaning of the correlation between words based on multi-head attention")
     }
     Note: The provided context contains several incorrect labels for the emergency types. This SPARQL query will not return the correct answer. It is for illustrative purposes only.

    If the provided context contains correct labels for the emergency types, the query should return the correct answer. The answer is "http://orkg.org/orkg/class/Resource".
