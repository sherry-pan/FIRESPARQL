Okay, so I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the Atari 2600 Zaxxon dataset. The question is asking about metrics used in evaluation, so I should focus on properties related to evaluation, metrics, and performance.

Looking through the JSON, I see several properties that stand out. First, "evaluation" with the label "evaluation" seems directly relevant because it's about assessing model performance. Then, "Recall" is a common metric used in evaluations, so that's a good fit. "Accuracy" is another fundamental metric that measures how correct the model is. "macro-F1" and "micro-F1" are specific F1 scores which are important for classification tasks. "NDCG@10" is a ranking metric, which might be used if the dataset involves ranked items. "Avg Characters", "Avg words", "Avg Entity", and "Avg Concept" could relate to the dataset's characteristics, which might influence model evaluation. "has training set" and "validation set" are about data splitting, which is crucial for training and testing. "has uncertainty value" and "has uncertainty unit" might be relevant if the model outputs uncertainties. "classification system" could be applicable if the dataset is used for classification tasks. "Quantitative methods" suggests numerical assessments, which are part of evaluation. "Risk types" and "Types of riks" might relate to specific evaluation aspects, though I'm less sure about these. "lesson learned" could be about insights from the evaluation. "CO2 footprint process" seems less relevant unless it's about environmental impact, which might not be directly related. "Token per News" doesn't seem applicable here. "method" is relevant as it's about the approach used. "PM25_prcnt_change" and "city" don't seem related to model evaluation. "tabular dataset" and "column type annotation" might describe the dataset structure, which is useful. "matching strategy" and "table selection technique" could be about how data is processed. "label generation technique" and "spliting technique" relate to data preparation. "column entity annotation" and "column property annotation" are about data specifics. "system module" and "controller" might be about the system architecture. "Plane" is unclear in this context. "has classes" and "number of type" relate to classification. "data splitting method" and "reporting level" are about how data is handled. "knowledge graph name" and "using an ontology" might be about data organization. "has training set" and "has uncertainty value" again relate to data and model aspects. "has benchmark" is about standard tests. "has dataset" is about the data itself. "has implementation" is about how the model is built. "method applied to unit membranes yields staining result" seems unrelated. "third prize comment", "# core participant", "# table", "# column", "# row", "# classes", "# entity", "# avg row", "# avg column", "# CEA target", "# CTA target", "# CPA target", "property of the dataset", "dataset annotation type", "split into", "# accepted submission", "# rejected submission", "# poster", "matching strategy", "system module", "table selection technique", "label generation technique", "spliting technique", "city", "method", "PM25_prcnt_change", "co-located with", "lesson learned", "# DBpedia properties", "# Schema.org property", "# schema.org class", "# CTA participant" are all either too specific or unrelated to evaluation metrics.

So, focusing on the most relevant ones, I'll list properties related to evaluation, metrics, and data handling.

Here is a list of the most relevant properties from the JSON file that could help answer the question about metrics used to evaluate models on the Atari 2600 Zaxxon dataset:

```json
[
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71075",
    "label": "hasEvaluation",
    "reason": "Directly relates to evaluation, which is central to assessing model performance."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71079",
    "label": "Recall",
    "reason": "A common metric used in evaluating model performance, especially in classification tasks."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71081",
    "label": "Accuracy",
    "reason": "A fundamental metric measuring the correctness of model predictions."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71080",
    "label": "micro-F1",
    "reason": "Specific F1 score metric used for evaluating classification models."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71082",
    "label": "macro-F1",
    "reason": "Another F1 score metric, providing a broader view of model performance."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71068",
    "label": "reporting level",
    "reason": "Indicates the granularity at which results are reported, relevant for evaluation."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71067",
    "label": "data splitting method",
    "reason": "Relates to how data is divided into training and testing sets, crucial for evaluation."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71096",
    "label": "validation set",
    "reason": "Specific to the dataset used for model validation, a key part of evaluation."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71086",
    "label": "has training set",
    "reason": "Indicates the presence of a training set, essential for model development and evaluation."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71092",
    "label": "has uncertainty value",
    "reason": "Relevant if models output uncertainty measures, which can be part of evaluation."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71094",
    "label": "classification system",
    "reason": "Applicable if the dataset is used for classification tasks, influencing evaluation metrics."
  }
]
```

These properties cover various aspects of model evaluation, including specific metrics, data handling, and system performance.
