Question:
What is the top benchmark score and its metric on the Words in Context dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric,?value
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Words in Context")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
        ?eval           orkgp:HAS_VALUE        ?value;
                         orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.
       } ORDER BY DESC(?value) LIMIT 1; 
    If there are multiple top scores, it's not clear what the "top" score is, so we will assume the first one is the top score. 
    If you want to modify the query to get the top k scores, you can use the LIMIT clause. 
    If you want to get all top scores, you can remove the LIMIT clause. 
    If you want to get the top score for a different metric, you can change the column we are ordering by. 
    You can also change the dataset to query. 
    You can also change the metric to query. 
    You can also change the evaluation type to query. 
    If you want to filter the results to only include results where the value is greater than a certain threshold, you can add a FILTER clause before the WHERE clause. 
    If you want to filter the results to only include results where the metric is a certain value, you can add a FILTER clause before the WHERE clause. 
    If you want to filter the results to only include results where the dataset is a certain value, you can add a FILTER clause before the WHERE clause. 
    If you want to filter the results to only include results where the evaluation type is a certain value, you can add a FILTER clause before the WHERE clause. 
    If you want to filter the results to only include results where the value is greater than a certain threshold, you can add a FILTER clause before the WHERE clause. 
    If you want to filter the results to only include results where the value is less than a certain threshold, you can add a FILTER clause before the WHERE clause. 
    If you want to filter the results to only include results where the value is equal to a certain threshold, you can add a FILTER clause before the WHERE clause. 
    If you want to filter the results to only include results where the value is not equal to a certain threshold, you can add a FILTER clause before the WHERE clause. 
    If you want to filter the results to only include results where the metric is not a certain value, you can add a FILTER clause before the WHERE clause. 
    If you want to filter the results to only include results where the metric is a certain value, you can add a FILTER clause before the WHERE clause. 
    If you want to filter the results to only include results where the metric is in a certain list of values, you can add a FILTER clause before the WHERE clause. 
    If you want to filter the results to only include results where the metric is not in a certain list of values, you can add a FILTER clause before the WHERE clause.
