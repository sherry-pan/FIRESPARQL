Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the IMDb-M benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?modelLabel WHERE {?model ork:hasModel?m.?m ork:hasLabel?mLabel. filter(bail(str(?mLabel) =?modelLabel)).?m ork:hasDataset?ds.?ds ork:hasDataset?dsLabel. filter(bail(str(?dsLabel) = "IMDb-M" || str(?dsLabel) = "IMDb-M benchmark dataset")).?m ork:hasEvaluations?ev.?ev ork:hasLabel?evLabel. filter(bail(str(?evLabel) = "tested on" || str(?evLabel) = "tested on the IMDb-M benchmark dataset")). }
    SELECT?model?modelLabel WHERE {?model ork:hasModel?m.?m ork:hasLabel?mLabel. filter(bail(str(?mLabel) =?modelLabel)).?m ork:hasDataset?ds.?ds ork:hasDataset?dsLabel. filter(bail(str(?dsLabel) = "IMDb-M" || str(?dsLabel) = "IMDb-M benchmark dataset")).?m ork:hasEvaluations?ev.?ev ork:hasLabel?evLabel. filter(bail(str(?evLabel) = "tested on" || str(?evLabel) = "tested on the IMDb-M benchmark dataset")). } 

    The provided context indicates that the entities "IMDb-M" and "IMDb-M benchmark dataset" are directly linked to the property "hasDataset". However, the query does not filter the dataset to only include the one that has a specific evaluation statement. This could lead to incorrect results. The query should be modified to filter the results to only include the dataset that has been "tested on" by a specific model. 

    To address this, we need to modify the query to include the evaluation statement "tested on the IMDb-M benchmark dataset" as a filter condition. The query should be modified to filter the results to only include the dataset that has been "tested on" by a specific model. 

    Here is the corrected SPARQL query:
    SELECT?model?modelLabel WHERE {?model ork:hasModel?m.?m ork:hasLabel?mLabel. filter(bail(str(?mLabel) =?modelLabel)).?m ork:hasDataset?ds.?ds ork:hasDataset?dsLabel. filter(bail(str(?dsLabel) = "IMDb-M" || str(?dsLabel) = "IMDb-M benchmark dataset")).?m ork:hasEvaluations?ev.?ev ork:hasLabel?evLabel. filter(bail(str(?evLabel) = "tested on the IMDb-M benchmark dataset")). filter(?ds ork:hasEvaluation?ev). } 

    In this corrected query, we added an additional filter condition to only include the dataset that has been "tested on" by a specific model. The condition
