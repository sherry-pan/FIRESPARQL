Question:
Which model has achieved the highest Accuracy score on the Story Cloze Test benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
```sql
PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.io/ontology#>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkg.io/predicate#>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://orkg.io/class#>

SELECT?model?accuracyScore
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:hasModel orkg:R122689.
 ?model orkgp:hasScore?accuracyScore.
 ?accuracyScore orkgc:Highest?highest.
 ?highest orkgc:Accuracy?accuracy.
  filter(?accuracy = max(?accuracy ) )
}
```
    Note: The `max` function is not a standard SPARQL function. It's used here for illustration purposes only. In a real-world scenario, you would use a SPARQL query optimization technique or a query engine that supports this function.

    In this SPARQL query, the following variables are used:
    - `?model`: The model that achieved the highest Accuracy score.
    - `?accuracyScore`: The highest Accuracy score achieved by the model.
    - `?highest`: The highest Accuracy score.
    - `?accuracy`: The Accuracy score.

    The query works as follows:
    1. It selects all models (`?model`) that have the `Story Cloze Test` benchmark dataset (`orkgr:R122689`) as their dataset (`orkgp:hasDataset`).
    2. For each model, it selects the score (`?accuracyScore`) that the model has (`orkgp:hasScore`).
    3. For each score, it checks if the score is the highest (`orkgc:Highest`) and the Accuracy class
