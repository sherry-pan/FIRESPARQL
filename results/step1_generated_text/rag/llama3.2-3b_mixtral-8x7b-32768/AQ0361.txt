Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the SciERC dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    
    SELECT?title?id?uri
    WHERE {
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?paperpaper.
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_TITLE?paperpaper.
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_ID?paperpaper.
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
     ?dataset orkgr:RMatch "SciERC dataset"@en.
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
     ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_PAPER?benchmarkpaper.
     ?benchmarkpaper orkgp:HAS_TITLE?title.
     ?benchmarkpaper orkgp:HAS_ID?id.
     ?benchmarkpaper orkgp:uri?uri.
      BIND(Concat(?title, " ",?id) AS?result).
      FILTER(BOUND(?title) && BOUND(?id) && BOUND(?uri))
    }
```sparql
    Note that the `PREFIX` declarations are not included in the output. 

    The generated SPARQL query retrieves all the papers that have performed benchmarks on the SciERC dataset, along with their titles and IDs. The query uses the following predicates:
    - `orkgp:HAS_PAPER` to link research papers to the query result
    - `orkgp:HAS_TITLE` to link titles to the query result
    - `orkgp:HAS_ID` to link IDs to the query result
    - `orkgp:HAS_DATASET` to link datasets to the query result
    - `orkgr:RMatch` to link datasets to the SciERC dataset
    - `orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK` to link benchmarks to the query result
    - `orkgp:HAS_PAPER` to link benchmarks to the query result
    - `orkgp:HAS_TITLE` and `orkgp:HAS_ID` to link benchmarks to the query result
