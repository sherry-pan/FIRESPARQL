Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the TempEval-3 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?title?id
    WHERE {
     ?paper a ora:Paper.
     ?paper ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
     ?benchmark ora:hasDataset?dataset.
     ?dataset rdfs:label?datasetLabel.
     ?dataset rdfs:label "TempEval-3"@en.
     ?paper ora:hasTitle?title.
     ?paper ora:hasID?id.
    } 
    SELECT?paper?id 
    WHERE {
     ?paper ora:hasPaper?paperPaper.
     ?paperPaper ora:hasTitle?paperTitle.
     ?paperPaper ora:hasID?paperId.
     ?paperTitle rdfs:label?paperTitleLabel.
     ?paperId rdfs:label?paperIdLabel.
      FILTER (str(?paperTitleLabel) = "TempEval-3"@en)
      FILTER (str(?paperIdLabel) = "TempEval-3"@en)
     ?paper ora:hasPaper?paperPaper.
    } 

    Note: You can assume that the "TempEval-3" dataset is a resource that has a label "TempEval-3"@en. Similarly, assume that a research paper has a label that can be used to filter the results. Since the question mentions "a benchmark for the TempEval-3 dataset", it is assumed that the benchmark is for the TempEval-3 dataset. The question also asks for the "titles and IDs" of research papers. Therefore, it is assumed that a research paper has a title and ID.
