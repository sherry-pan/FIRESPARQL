Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the TempEval-3 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?metric?dataset
WHERE {
 ?metric orkgp:P39020 orkgr:TempEval-3_dataset.
  FILTER (rdfs:label?metric)
}
``` 
    Note: The SPARQL query is written assuming the RDF data is available at the base URI "http://example.org/orkgr/" and the property "benchmarking models on" has URI "http://example.org/orkgp:P39020". The actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data and property URIs. 

    Please note that this is a simplified example and the actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data and property URIs. The RDF data and property URIs used in this example are fictional and may not match the actual RDF data and property URIs in the ORKG. 

    The actual SPARQL query may need to include additional filters or join conditions to accurately retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the evaluation metrics and the TempEval-3 dataset, but it may need to be adjusted to retrieve additional information or to handle cases where the evaluation metrics or the dataset are not directly linked to the property "benchmarking models on". 

    The SPARQL query is also designed to use the RDF labels of the evaluation metrics and the TempEval-3 dataset, but it may need to be adjusted to use other RDF properties or predicates if the actual RDF data uses different properties or predicates. 

    The SPARQL query is a simplified example and may not cover all possible cases or scenarios. 

    The actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data and the specific requirements of the application.
