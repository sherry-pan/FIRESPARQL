Question:
What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the WMT2016 English-Russian dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric?metric_lbl (MAX(?value) AS?value_lbl)
     WHERE {
     ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                     rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
      FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WMT2016 English-Russian dataset")
     ?cont         orkgp:P31           ?dataset.
     ?benchmark    orkgp:HAS_DATASET     ?cont;
                   orkgp:P32           ?eval.
     ?eval         orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION  ?eval_lbl.
     ?eval         rdfs:label             ?eval_lbl_lbl.
      FILTER (str(?eval_lbl_lbl) = "eval_lbl")
     ?eval         orkgp:HAS_METRIC       ?metric.
     ?metric       rdfs:label             ?metric_lbl.
      OPTIONAL {?eval       orkgp:HAS_VALUE        ?value.
              ?value       rdfs:label             ?value_lbl.}
     ?cont         orkgp:P33           ?result.
     ?result       orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK_RESULT ?eval.
     ?eval         orkgp:HAS_VALUE          ?value.
     ?value       rdfs:label             ?value_lbl.
      BIND(xsd:decimal(?value_lbl) AS?value_lbl)
      }  ORDER BY DESC(?value_lbl)    LIMIT 1;  Note that the output will be a single row containing the value of the highest benchmark result.

This problem is about generating a SPARQL query based on a given natural language question. The question is about finding the highest benchmark result achieved on a specific dataset, and the query needs to include the metric and its value. The context provided includes the terms mentioned in the question, candidate entities and properties in the ORKG, and the actual entities and properties in the dataset.

## Step 1: Understand the question and identify the key terms.
The question is asking for the highest benchmark result achieved on the WMT2016 English-Russian dataset, including the metric and its value.

## Step 2: Identify the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
The entities mentioned in the question are "WMT2016 English-Russian dataset" and "highest benchmark result". The properties mentioned are "metric" and "value".

## Step 3: Map the entities and properties to the actual entities and properties in the ORKG.
From the context, we can map the entities
