Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Sequential CIFAR-10 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/predicates/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT?metric?metricLabel
WHERE {
 ?metric orkp:hasMetric?model.
 ?model orkp:benchmarkOn?dataset.
 ?dataset orkg:label "Sequential CIFAR-10 dataset"@en.
 ?metric orkp:hasLabel?metricLabel.
  FILTER (STR(?metricLabel) = "F1-score" OR STR(?metricLabel) = "accuracy")
}
```    Output ends here.

This response follows the format you specified, but please note that the actual task involves creating a SPARQL query from a given RDF data dump, which is not provided here. 

If you provide the actual RDF data dump, I can help you create a correct SPARQL query.
