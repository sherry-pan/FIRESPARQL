Question:
Can you provide the highest benchmark result, including the metric and score, for the Natural Questions (long) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

    SELECT?resource?metric?score
    WHERE {
     ?resource orkgp:hasMetric?metric.
     ?resource orkgp:hasScore?score.
     ?metric orkgp:hasValue?value.
      FILTER (STR(?value) = "93.9").
     ?resource orkgc:label?resourceLabel.
      FILTER (STR(?resourceLabel) = "Natural Questions (long) dataset").
     ?resource orkgc:type orkgc:Resource.
    }
    ```    Note: The above SPARQL query is a simplified version and may not cover all possible cases. It is intended to illustrate the format of the query and is not a complete solution. In a real-world scenario, you would need to adjust the query to fit the specific requirements of the ORKG and the input question.<|eot_id|>
