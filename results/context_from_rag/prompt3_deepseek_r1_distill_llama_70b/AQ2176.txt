Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PAR Transformer Large model for benchmarking purposes?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The key entities and properties mentioned are "code references," "papers," "PAR Transformer Large model," and "benchmarking purposes." 

Looking through the context, I see information about various resources and predicates. For example, there are entries about papers, models, datasets, and methods. The predicates include things like HAS_VALUE, P31 (which seems to relate to classes), HAS_VENUE, P29 (year), P28 (volume), P27 (authors), and others.

I need to find entities related to "code references." In the context, I don't see any direct mentions of code, but there are resources like R147652 which describes steps involving NER approaches and CRF algorithms. There's also R283709, which is a journal article with keywords like "Graph analytics" and "Named entity recognition." 

For "papers," I can look for resources of type "Journal Article." R147246 and R283709 are both journal articles. They have authors, venues, years, etc. 

The "PAR Transformer Large model" isn't directly mentioned, but there are models like "SVM" referenced in the steps. Since PAR Transformer isn't present, I might need to consider similar models or related resources.

"Benchmarking purposes" could relate to evaluation methods or datasets used for testing. Resources like R147652 discuss steps involving benchmarking with datasets like MNIST.

Now, I'll try to map these terms to the RDF data. "Code references" might be linked through predicates that indicate implementation or application, but since there's no direct code info, I'll focus on papers that used specific models for benchmarking.

Looking at R283709, it's about entity extraction and uses methods like keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition. It mentions "Graph analytics" and "Horizon 2020," which might be related to benchmarking.

R147246 is another paper with multiple authors, published in 2015. It doesn't specify models but discusses methods that could be benchmarked.

Since the PAR Transformer isn't in the data, I'll consider other models mentioned, like those in R147652, which uses SVM and MNIST. These might be part of benchmarking processes.

I'll structure the candidates by extracted terms. For "code references," I'll include resources that discuss methods or implementations. For "papers," I'll list the journal articles. For the model, I'll include any mentioned models, even if not PAR Transformer. For "benchmarking," I'll include relevant resources and predicates.

I need to ensure the URIs use the correct prefixes: orkgr: for resources, orkgp: for predicates, etc. Each candidate should have a URI, label, and type.

Finally, I'll compile the JSON, grouping the results under each extracted term with their respective candidates.
