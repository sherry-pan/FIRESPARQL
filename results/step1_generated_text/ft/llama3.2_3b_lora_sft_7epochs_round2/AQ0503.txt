Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the BIOSSES dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
        ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                     rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "BIOSSES")
        ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                         orkgp:P32             ?cont.
        ?cont           orkgp:HAS_PAPER        ?paper.
        ?paper         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
     }<|eot_id|>
