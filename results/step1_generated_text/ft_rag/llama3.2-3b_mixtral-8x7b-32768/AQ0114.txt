Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the BoolQ dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "BoolQ")
        ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
        ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
        ?eval          orkgp:P31              ?cont.
        ?model        orkgp:HAS_MODEL        ?cont.
        ?model_lbl    rdfs:label              ?model.
     }   



```python
SELECT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                 rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "BoolQ")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?eval          orkgp:P31              ?cont.
 ?model        orkgp:HAS_MODEL        ?cont.
 ?model_lbl    rdfs:label              ?model.
}
```


      - **Note:** The code does not need to be run to generate the SPARQL query. The SPARQL query is directly generated from the given input question and context. The answer to the input question is the models that have been benchmarked on the BoolQ dataset.
      - **Note:** The SPARQL query is in the format that can be executed directly in the SPARQL query editor of the ORKG.
      - **Note:** The SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG. The provided SPARQL query is based on the provided context. The actual structure of the ORKG may differ.
      - **Note:** The SPARQL query is only one possible way to answer the input question. There may be other valid SPARQL queries that can also answer the input question.
      - **Note:** The SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual data in the ORKG. The provided SPARQL query is based on the provided context. The actual data in the ORKG may differ.<|eot_id|>
