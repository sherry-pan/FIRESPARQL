Question:
What is the name of the top performing model in terms of Score score when benchmarked on the Cart Pole (OpenAI Gym) dataset?

 ?model a ora:Model.
 ?model ora:hasScore?score.
 ?score ora:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasName "CartPole-v0".
 ?score ora:hasName?scoreName.
  FILTER (STR(?scoreName) = "Score").
 ?model ora:hasName?name.
  FILTER (STR(?name) = "Top Performing Model").
}
```
