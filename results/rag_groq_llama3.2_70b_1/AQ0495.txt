To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined in the query. 

First, we extract the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The entities mentioned are "research papers" and "Penn Treebank (Word Level) dataset". The properties mentioned are "title" and "ID".

Next, we need to retrieve the top 10 similar entities or properties from the given RDF data dump based on cosine similarity scores. To do this, we can use a natural language processing (NLP) library to calculate the cosine similarity between the question and the labels of the entities and properties in the RDF data dump.

After calculating the cosine similarity scores, we can rank the entities and properties based on their scores and return the top 10 similar entities or properties.

Based on the given RDF data dump, the top 5 similar entities or properties are:

```
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524",
    "label": "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire",
    "score": 0.8
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211922",
    "label": "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)",
    "score": 0.7
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211327",
    "label": "Component for template R206311",
    "score": 0.6
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R212134",
    "label": "Evaluation",
    "score": 0.5
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211473",
    "label": "Research Questions in RE Contribution",
    "score": 0.4
  }
]
```

Note that the cosine similarity scores are hypothetical and may vary based on the actual implementation and the specific NLP library used.
