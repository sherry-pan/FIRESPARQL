To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined:

1. **Extract entities and properties from the question**: The question mentions "research papers", "benchmark", and "arXiv dataset". These are the key concepts we need to focus on.

2. **Retrieve similar entities or properties from the RDF data dump**: We will look for entities or properties in the RDF data dump that are related to "research papers", "benchmark", and "arXiv dataset".

After analyzing the RDF data dump, we find the following entities that are related to the question:

- **R211524**: This entity is a research paper with the title "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire". Although it's not directly related to the arXiv dataset, it's a research paper that includes a dataset, which is similar to what the question is asking.
- **R211922**: This entity is a research paper with the title "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)". Similar to R211524, it's a research paper but not directly related to the arXiv dataset.
- **R211327**: This entity is also a research paper, but its title is not specified in the given RDF data dump.
- **R75841**: This entity is a paper, but its title is not specified in the given RDF data dump.
- **R212134**: This entity is an evaluation, which could be related to a benchmark.

Since the RDF data dump does not provide direct information about the arXiv dataset or benchmarks for it, we will have to rely on the entities that are related to research papers and evaluations.

Here is the list of dictionaries in JSON format with the top 5 similar entities or properties:

```json
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524",
    "label": "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire",
    "score": 0.8
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211922",
    "label": "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)",
    "score": 0.7
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R212134",
    "label": "Evaluation",
    "score": 0.6
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211327",
    "label": null,
    "score": 0.5
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R75841",
    "label": null,
    "score": 0.4
  }
]
```

Note: The scores are hypothetical and based on the assumption that the entities with more relevant labels (e.g., "research paper") would have higher similarity scores. In a real-world scenario, these scores would be calculated using a cosine similarity algorithm or a similar method.
