     ?paper orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
     ?dataset orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?benchmark.
     ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
     ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?paper.
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_TITLE?title.
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_ID?paper_id.
      FILTER (str(?dataset_label) = "WSC")
    }<|eot_id|>
