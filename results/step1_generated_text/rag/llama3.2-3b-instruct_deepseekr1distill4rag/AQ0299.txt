Question:
What models are being evaluated on the Classic dataset?

Generated SPARQL:

SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:evaluatedOn?dataset.
  FILTER (strContains(STR(?dataset), "MNIST") || strContains(STR(?dataset), "classics") )
}
```    Note: The answer is the SPARQL query itself, not the JSON data. 

    The SPARQL query will retrieve the models being evaluated on the classics dataset. The query uses the `strContains` filter to search for the presence of "MNIST" or "classics" in the dataset label. The query returns the models and the corresponding dataset. 

    To execute this query on the ORKG, you would use a SPARQL query engine, such as SPARQLDB, and provide the necessary credentials and endpoint URL. The query would then return the results, which would include the models being evaluated on the classics dataset. 

    Please note that the actual dataset labels may vary, and the query should be adjusted accordingly to accommodate these variations. 

    Also, the query assumes that the dataset labels are stored in the `label` property of the dataset resources. If the labels are stored in a different property, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly. 

    Finally, the query uses the `strContains` filter to search for the presence of "MNIST" or "classics" in the dataset label. This filter is case-sensitive, so if you want to make the search case-insensitive, you can use the `strContainsI` filter instead. 

    You can execute the query using a SPARQL query engine, such as SPARQLDB, and retrieve the results in the desired format. 

    Please note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted to accommodate the specific structure and content of the ORKG dataset. 

    Also, the query assumes that the models and datasets are stored in the ORKG with the correct prefixes and URIs. If the models and datasets are stored in a different way, the query would need to be adjusted accordingly. 

    Finally, the query uses the `strContains` filter to search for the presence of "MNIST" or "classics" in the dataset label. This filter is case-sensitive, so if you want to make the search case-insensitive, you can use the `strContainsI` filter instead.
