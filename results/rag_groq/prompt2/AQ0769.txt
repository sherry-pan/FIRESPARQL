Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the WMT2014 English-German dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. 

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The main entities here are "evaluation metrics" and "WMT2014 English-German dataset." The property connecting them is "benchmarking models on."

Looking at the context, I see that there are two main resources, R147652 and R284316, each with multiple steps and some metrics. R147652 has steps related to a method involving SVM and MNIST, and mentions metrics like F1-score and accuracy. R284316 talks about a journal article on extracting entity knowledge, using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

I need to extract the terms "evaluation metrics," "benchmarking models," and "WMT2014 English-German dataset." Wait, but in the context, I don't see the WMT2014 dataset explicitly mentioned. The closest is R147652 which uses MNIST, and R284316 which uses AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP datasets. So maybe the WMT2014 dataset isn't present, but I can infer that evaluation metrics are discussed in both resources.

Next, I'll compute similarity. Since WMT2014 isn't in the data, I'll focus on the metrics mentioned. Both resources mention F1-score, precision, recall, and accuracy. So these would be the top candidates for evaluation metrics. For benchmarking, the context uses terms like "evaluated on" and "performance assessment."

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their candidates. Since the dataset isn't present, I'll note that under the dataset section with a score of 0.0. The metrics will have higher scores based on their relevance.

I need to make sure the URIs use the correct prefixes: orkgr for resources, orkgp for properties, and rdfs:label for labels. Also, include the types correctly, like orkgc:Resource for datasets and orkgp:Predicate for properties.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have the question, extracted terms, and candidates with their scores and types.
