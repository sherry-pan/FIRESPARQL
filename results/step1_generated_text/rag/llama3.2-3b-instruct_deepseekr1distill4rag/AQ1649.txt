Question:
Which model has achieved the highest SUCCESS score on the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?score
WHERE {
 ?model a ora:Model.
 ?model ora:achieved?score.
 ?score ora:property ora:P97004.
 ?score ora:property ora:P97004.
 ?model ora:associated?dataset.
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset ora:dataset "Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std benchmark dataset".
  FILTER (str(?score) = "max")
}
``` 
    Note: The SPARQL query is generated based on the provided input question and context information. The query is designed to retrieve the correct answer from the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    The query works as follows:

    1. It selects the `?model` and `?score` variables to retrieve the information about the model with the highest SUCCESS score.
    2. It uses the `ora:Model` and `ora:achieved` predicates to link the model to its SUCCESS score.
    3. It uses the `ora:P97004` property to link the SUCCESS score to the property being queried (SUCCESS score).
    4. It uses the `ora:associated` predicate to link the model to the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std benchmark dataset.
    5. It uses the `ora:dataset` predicate to link the dataset to the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std benchmark dataset.
    6. Finally, it filters the results to only include the model with the highest SUCCESS score using the `str(?score) = "max"` filter. 

    This query is designed to retrieve the correct answer to the input question from the ORKG RDF data dump.<|eot_id|>
