Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Rotowire (Content Selection) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Rotowire (Content Selection)")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?paper         orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?paper         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
     }<|eot_id|>
