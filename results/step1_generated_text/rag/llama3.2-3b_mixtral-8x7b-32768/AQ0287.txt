Question:
What models are being evaluated on the Atari 2600 Chopper Command dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:has_model?model_name.
 ?dataset orkgp:has_dataset?dataset_name.
 ?model orkgp:evaluated_on?dataset.
  FILTER (?model_name = "Atari 2600 Chopper Command").
  FILTER (?dataset_name = "Atari 2600 Chopper Command").
}
``` 
    Note: The above SPARQL query is a possible query to answer the question. There may be other possible queries that can also answer the question. 

    The SPARQL query is based on the following assumptions:
    - The "Atari 2600 Chopper Command dataset" is the only dataset being evaluated on by the models.
    - The "Atari 2600 Chopper Command dataset" is the only model being evaluated on.
    - The models being evaluated on are stored in the ORKG with the "has model" property and the dataset being evaluated on is stored in the ORKG with the "has dataset" property.
    - The models being evaluated on are stored in the ORKG with the "evaluated on" property.

    The SPARQL query is based on the provided context and the extracted terms from the question. The query is designed to retrieve the models that are being evaluated on the Atari 2600 Chopper Command dataset. 

    Please note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG and the specific entities and properties present in the graph.
