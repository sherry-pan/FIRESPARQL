Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the Gibson PointGoal Navigation dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

    SELECT?title?id
    WHERE {
     ?paper orkg:hasPaper?p.
     ?p orkggp:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
     ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset?dataset.
     ?dataset orkgc:datasetLabel?title.
     ?paper orkggp:hasIdentifier?id.
      FILTER (?dataset = <http://example.org/orkg/R122689> )
    }
    ``` 
    Note: The dataset labels and identifiers are placeholders and may need to be replaced with actual values from the ORKG.

    Note that the outputted query assumes that the input question's context information is correct and that the entities/properties mentioned in the question are correctly linked in the ORKG. The query is designed to retrieve the desired information based on the provided context information. 

    To get the actual SPARQL query that would run on the actual ORKG, you would need to replace the placeholder dataset labels and identifiers with the actual values from the ORKG, and also replace the prefix declarations with the actual prefix declarations used in the ORKG. 

    The outputted query is based on the assumption that the entities/properties mentioned in the question are correctly linked in the ORKG, and that the context information provided is correct. 

    The actual query that would run on the actual ORKG would depend on the actual structure and content of the ORKG. 

    This query is for demonstration purposes only.
