Question:
What are the metrics of evaluation over the Atari 2600 Double Dunk dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

    SELECT?metric?dataset
    WHERE {
       ?dataset orkgp:HAS_DATASET?metric.
       ?metric orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?dataset.
        FILTER (bc:contains(?dataset, "Atari 2600 Double Dunk") && bc:contains(?metric, "metrics of evaluation"))
    }
    ``` 
    Note that the actual prefix declarations and the actual URIs in the context may vary based on the actual structure of the Open Research Knowledge Graph. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to find the metrics of evaluation over the Atari 2600 Double Dunk dataset. It starts by selecting all metrics that have a dataset as their value (or vice versa), and then filters the results to only include those where the dataset contains the string "Atari 2600 Double Dunk" and the metric contains the string "metrics of evaluation". 

    Please note that the actual URIs used in the query are fictional and are used only for illustration purposes. You should replace them with the actual URIs from the Open Research Knowledge Graph. 

    The actual SPARQL query may need to be modified based on the actual structure of the Open Research Knowledge Graph and the actual entities and properties present in it. 

    If you have any further questions or need additional clarification, feel free to ask! 

    The final answer is the SPARQL query itself. 

    Do not forget to add the box around the final answer. 

    The final answer is: 
```
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
