Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the NASCell model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?paper?model?code
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgc:hasBenchmark?model.
 ?paper orkgr:hasCode?code.
  SERVICE orkgr:filter {
    bind((?paper orkgr:hasCode?code) AS?filter)
    bind((?paper orkgr:hasBenchmark?model) AS?benchmarkFilter)
    filter (?benchmarkFilter &&?filter)
  }
}
```    Note: The ORKG RDF data dump is not provided. The provided RDF prefixes are fictional and for demonstration purposes only. The actual SPARQL query would depend on the actual RDF data provided. 

    This SPARQL query is designed to retrieve papers that benchmark the NASCell model and have links to code. The query uses the `orkgc:hasBenchmark` and `orkgr:hasCode` predicates to filter the results. The `SERVICE orkgr:filter` clause is used to combine the two filters using the `&&` operator. 

    Note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data provided, including the URIs and labels of the papers, models, and codes.
