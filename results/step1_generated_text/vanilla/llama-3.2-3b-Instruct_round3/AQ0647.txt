Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the WOS-46985 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT?paper?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper wos:dataset "WOS:46985".
  SERVICE dfn:dataset {
    bd:service <http://linked.data.columbia.edu/dfn/sparql/>.
  }
}
```<|eot_id|>
