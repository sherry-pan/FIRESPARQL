To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined:

1. **Extract entities and properties from the question**: The question mentions "top benchmark score", "metric", and "MAZEA dataset". These are the key entities and properties we are interested in.

2. **Retrieve similar entities or properties from the RDF data dump**: Since the provided RDF data dump is in Turtle format, we would typically parse this data to extract entities and their labels, then calculate the cosine similarity between the question and each entity/property label. However, given the constraints of this task and the format of the provided data, we'll proceed conceptually.

3. **Calculate cosine similarity**: This step involves converting text into vectors (using techniques like word embeddings) and then calculating the cosine similarity between the question vector and each entity/property vector from the RDF data.

Given the nature of the task and the data provided, we'll simulate the outcome based on the information given:

- **Entities/Properties of Interest**:
  - R76234 (BabelEnconding)
  - R76243 (looked at different ways to measure similarity between embeddings)
  - R76244 (Team 2 Subtask 1 English)
  - R75430 (IBM Journal of Research and Development)
  - R75431 (Contribution 1)
  - R75840 (Factors influencing evidence-based decision-making in humanitarian response)
  - R75841 (Paper)
  - R163201 (Wikipedia-based Named Entity Recognition)
  - R162991 (Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study)
  - R162992 (Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing)

- **Similarity Calculation**:
  - This step is highly dependent on the specific implementation of cosine similarity and the vector representation of the text. For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume we've calculated the similarity scores.

- **Top 5 Similar Entities/Properties**:
  - Due to the lack of direct relevance of the provided RDF entities to the question about "top benchmark score" and "metric on the MAZEA dataset", and without actual calculation tools or libraries at our disposal in this format, we'll provide a conceptual answer.

Assuming the calculation of cosine similarity between the question and the labels of entities/properties in the RDF data, a possible top 5 list (if such relevant entities existed in the data) might look like this in JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R76243",
    "label": "looked at different ways to measure similarity between embeddings",
    "score": 0.8
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R163201",
    "label": "Wikipedia-based Named Entity Recognition",
    "score": 0.7
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R162991",
    "label": "Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study",
    "score": 0.65
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R75840",
    "label": "Factors influencing evidence-based decision-making in humanitarian response",
    "score": 0.6
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R162992",
    "label": "Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing",
    "score": 0.55
  }
]
```

Please note, the actual calculation of similarity scores and the selection of top entities/properties would depend on the specific vector representations of the question and the entity/property labels, and how closely they relate to the concepts of "benchmark score" and "metric on the MAZEA dataset", which are not directly addressed in the provided RDF data dump.
