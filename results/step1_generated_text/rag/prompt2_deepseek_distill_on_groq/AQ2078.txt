Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking for links to code used in papers that benchmark the BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo (ensemble) model. 

First, I'll look through the context information. The context has two main sections from the ORKG RDF data dump. The first part describes a research process with steps, and the second part talks about a journal article titled "validation research" with some authors and a DOI link.

Looking at the first part, I see steps 1 through 5, which discuss methods like NER and using CRF algorithms. The second part has a resource R284317 with a URL "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075" and a DOI "10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075". 

The user is asking for code links related to a specific model ensemble. The context doesn't mention BiDAF, Self Attention, or ELMo. It does mention models like SVM and datasets like MNIST, but those aren't relevant here. The only URL provided is for a paper, not code.

Since the context doesn't have information about the specific model or code links, I can't retrieve any relevant candidates. Therefore, the candidates list for each extracted term will be empty.
