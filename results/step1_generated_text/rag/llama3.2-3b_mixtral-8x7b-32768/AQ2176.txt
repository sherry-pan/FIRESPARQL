Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PAR Transformer Large model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

    SELECT?paper?codeReference
    WHERE {
       ?paper orkp:HAS_PAPER?codePaper.
       ?codePaper orkp:HAS_CODE_REFERENCE?codeReference.
       ?paper orkgc:hasUsed?model.
       ?model orkgc:hasModelName "PAR Transformer Large".
       ?model orkgc:hasUsedFor?purpose.
       ?purpose orkgc:hasLabel "benchmarking purposes".
    }
    ```
    Please note that the provided SPARQL query is not necessarily the optimal one, it is just one possible solution based on the given context. The actual optimal solution may vary depending on the specific structure of the ORKG. 

    This question requires the ability to extract entities, properties, and relationships from the context and use them to generate a correct SPARQL query. The query should be able to filter papers that have used the PAR Transformer Large model for benchmarking purposes and retrieve the corresponding code references. 

    The solution involves the following steps:
    1.  Extracting the entities and properties mentioned in the question and the context.
    2.  Identifying the relationships between the entities and properties.
    3.  Generating a SPARQL query based on the extracted entities, properties, and relationships.
    4.  Optimizing the query to retrieve the correct answer to the input question.
    5.  Using the extracted entities and properties to link the correct entities or properties in the ORKG.
    6.  Filtering papers that have used the PAR Transformer Large model for benchmarking purposes.
    7.  Retrieving the corresponding code references for the filtered papers.
    8.  Outputting the SPARQL query as the solution.
    Note that the optimal solution may vary depending on the specific structure of the ORKG. 
    The provided SPARQL query is just one possible solution based on the given context. 

    The SPARQL query generated from the context is as follows:
    ```
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

    SELECT?paper?codeReference
    WHERE {
       ?paper orkp:HAS_PAPER?codePaper.
       ?codePaper orkp:HAS_CODE_REFERENCE?codeReference.
