Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. The query is asking for a list of papers that have used the ANODE model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the query. The main entities here are "papers" and "ANODE model". The properties involved would be "has used" (as in papers that have used the model) and "links to code" (which might be a property like "has code link" or something similar).

Looking at the provided context, I see two main resources: R147246 and R284316. R147246 seems to be a paper with authors like Ligia Sierra and others, published in 2015. R284316 is another paper from 2021 by Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta, and it has a URL and DOI link. 

I need to check if either of these papers mentions the ANODE model. From the context, R284316's abstract discusses entity recognition and linking, using models like Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight, but I don't see ANODE mentioned. R147246's information doesn't seem to relate to ANODE either.

Since the context doesn't explicitly mention the ANODE model, I might have to infer or check if any of the papers are related. However, based on the given data, there's no direct mention of ANODE. Therefore, I might have to conclude that there are no papers in the provided data that use ANODE.

But wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me double-check the context. R284316's abstract talks about a model called "jpark' for joint posterior revision. That's not ANODE. R147246 doesn't mention any specific models beyond SVM and MNIST in the steps.

So, it seems there's no information about the ANODE model in the provided data. Therefore, the answer would indicate that no relevant papers were found in the given context.
