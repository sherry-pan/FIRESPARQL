Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user is asking for a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs that have performed benchmarks on the Rotowire (Content Selection) dataset.

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of research papers, their titles, IDs, and any connections to the Rotowire dataset. 

Looking at the context, I see several resources like R147246 and R283710, which are papers. Each has properties like P27 for authors, P28 for issue numbers, P29 for years, and P31 for types. However, I don't see any direct mention of the Rotowire dataset or any benchmarks related to it in the provided context. 

The context does talk about methods and datasets in a general sense, like Steps 1 to 5, which involve expanding seed terms and applying NER approaches. There's also information about keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition, but nothing specific to Rotowire.

Since the context doesn't contain any specific data about the Rotowire dataset or papers benchmarking it, I can't extract any relevant entities or properties. Therefore, the candidates for each extracted term will be empty.
