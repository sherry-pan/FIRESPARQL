Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question about papers using the DY-MobileNetV3-Small model and their code links. Let me start by understanding the question. The user is asking for a list of papers that have used a specific model and wants links to their code. 

Looking at the JSON example, I see properties related to various aspects like methods, datasets, evaluations, etc. The question is about papers and their implementations, so I should focus on properties that relate to papers, implementations, and code.

First, I notice the property "HAS_IMPLEMENTATION" with the label "implementation". This seems relevant because it likely points to where the model is implemented, which could include code links.

Next, "HAS_METHOD" labeled as "method" is also important because it would describe the methods used in the papers, which in this case is the DY-MobileNetV3-Small model.

The property "HAS_DATASET" might be useful if the papers used specific datasets, but it's not directly about the model or code. However, it could provide context about where the model was applied.

I also see "evaluation" under "HAS_EVALUATION", which could relate to how the model's performance was assessed in the papers, but it's more about results than the code itself.

Considering the JSON example, "implementation" and "method" are the most directly relevant. "HAS_DATASET" and "evaluation" are secondary but still useful for providing a fuller picture of the model's usage in research.

So, I'll list these properties, explaining why each is relevant. "HAS_IMPLEMENTATION" for code links, "HAS_METHOD" for the model used, and "HAS_DATASET" and "evaluation" for context on application and performance.
