Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the MMV model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>

SELECT?p?o
WHERE {
 ?p a orkgc:Paper.
 ?p orkgp:HAS_CODE?o.
 ?p orkp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgp:RDF_TYPE orkp:BenchmarkingPurpose.
 ?benchmark orkgp:RDF_TYPE orkp:BenchmarkingPurpose.
 ?o orkgc:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
}
```
