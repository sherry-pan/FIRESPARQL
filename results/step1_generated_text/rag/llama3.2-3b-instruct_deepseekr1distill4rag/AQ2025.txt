Question:
List the code links in papers that use the Rfa-Gate-arccos model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?codeLink
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:Paper.
 ?paper ora:evaluatedOn?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?paper ora:codeLinks?codeLink.
  FILTER (str(?benchmark) = "Rfa-Gate-arccos")
}
```    Note: The above SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context and the input question. It is not guaranteed to produce the correct results. The actual query may need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data and the structure of the knowledge graph.<|eot_id|>
