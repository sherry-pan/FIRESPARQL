Question:
What are the most commonly used benchmark datasets for the Joint Entity and Relation Extraction research field?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc/>
    SELECT?dataset?label
    WHERE {
     ?dataset a orkc:Dataset.
     ?dataset orkg:hasApplication?application.
     ?application orkg:hasField?field.
     ?field a orkc:ResearchField.
     ?field rdfs:label?label.
      FILTER (STR(?label) = "Joint Entity and Relation Extraction" OR
              STR(?label) = "Entity Recognition" OR
              STR(?label) = "Relation Extraction" OR
              STR(?label) = "Natural Language Processing" OR
              STR(?label) = "Information Extraction" OR
              STR(?label) = "Knowledge Graph Construction")
      }
    }
``` 
    Note: This query is an example and may need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data in the ORKG. The example assumes that the dataset URIs are in the format `orkgr:<URI>`, and the property URIs are in the format `orkgc:<property>`. The actual RDF data may have different property names or formats. 

    Please note that the provided RDF data is fictional and for demonstration purposes only. In a real-world scenario, you would need to access the actual RDF data from the ORKG and adjust the query accordingly. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve datasets that have a field or application related to the Joint Entity and Relation Extraction research field. The query filters the results based on the label of the field or application, ensuring that only relevant datasets are returned.
