Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Switch Transformer model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

    SELECT?paper?code
    WHERE {
     ?paper orkp:hasUtilized?utilizedModel.
     ?utilizedModel orkp:hasCode?code.
     ?paper orkp:hasContribution?contribution.
     ?contribution orkgp:hasPaper?paper.
     ?paper orkg:label "Switch Transformer model".
      FILTER (regex(str(?paper), "Switch Transformer model"))
    }
    ``` 
    If you can't reproduce the output, please provide a link to the solution or explain the steps you have taken to arrive at the solution. 

    I have tried to follow the instructions to the letter and have attempted to provide the correct solution. However, I am unsure if my solution is correct. Please let me know if I need to revise anything.

    I have taken the following steps to solve the problem:
    1. I have analyzed the input question and extracted the key terms and phrases.
    2. I have identified the relevant entities and properties in the context that can be linked to the extracted terms.
    3. I have constructed the SPARQL query based on the relationships identified in the context.
    4. I have used the `SELECT` clause to specify the variables that we want to retrieve, and the `WHERE` clause to define the conditions under which we want to retrieve the variables.
    5. I have used the `FILTER` clause to apply a regular expression to the label of the paper to ensure that only papers with the label "Switch Transformer model" are included in the results.

    I believe that my solution is correct, but I am open to feedback and revisions. 

    I have used the following assumptions:
    1. The URI of the Switch Transformer model is "orkgr:R44243".
    2. The URI of the papers is "orkgr:R147246" and "orkgr:R36054".
    3. The predicates "utilized" and "links to their code" are represented
