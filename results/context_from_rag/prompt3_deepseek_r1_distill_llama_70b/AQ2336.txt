Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user is asking for a list of papers that have used the DQN-PixelCNN model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of the DQN-PixelCNN model. Scanning through the triples, I see that the context includes information about various resources, such as R147246 and R283710, which are papers with authors and publication details. However, I don't immediately see any direct references to the DQN-PixelCNN model.

Next, I'll check if there are any related entities or properties that might be connected to the model. The context includes terms like "models," "tested on," and "evaluated on," but again, no specific mention of DQN-PixelCNN. 

Since the model isn't explicitly mentioned, I might need to infer or find related concepts. The context does talk about methods like SVM and datasets like MNIST, but these aren't directly related to DQN-PixelCNN. 

I also notice that the context includes information about knowledge graphs, named entity recognition, and keyphrase extraction, which are methods used in processing the data, but not the specific model in question.

Given that the DQN-PixelCNN model isn't present in the provided context, I can't extract any specific papers or code links related to it. Therefore, the answer would be that there's no relevant information available based on the given data.

The provided context does not contain any information related to the DQN-PixelCNN model or papers that use it. Therefore, there are no relevant papers or code links to provide.
