Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
       orkgp:Paper rdfs:label?paper_label.
       FILTER (str(?paper_label) = "papers")
       orkgp:Paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?benchmark.
      ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
       FILTER (str(?code) = "BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model")
       orkgp:HAS_PAPER?paper.
      ?paper rdfs:label?paper_label.
     }
    0.008 s
    HINT: Use the `orkgp:HAS_PAPER` property to link the paper to the code. Also, use the `str` function to compare the labels of the code and the model. 

```sparql
SELECT?code
WHERE {
  orkgp:Paper rdfs:label?paper_label.
  FILTER (str(?paper_label) = "papers")
  orkgp:Paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
  FILTER (str(?code) = "BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model")
  orkgp:HAS_PAPER?paper.
 ?paper rdfs:label?paper_label.
}
```

The final answer is not a number. The problem requires generating a SPARQL query based on a given question and context. The correct SPARQL query is provided above. 

Note: The provided solution is based on the given context and does not require any numerical calculations. The answer is a SPARQL query that can be executed on the ORKG to retrieve the required information. 

Please let me know if you need any further clarification or details. 

Note: The answer is provided in the required format, but the problem does not require a numerical answer. The answer is a SPARQL query. 

However, I will provide the answer in the required format as per the instructions. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{SELECT?code WHERE { orkgp:Paper rdfs:label?paper_label. FILTER (str(?paper_label) = "papers") orkgp:Paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?benchmark.?benchmark orkgp:HAS_CODE?code. FILTER (str(?code) = "BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model") orkgp:HAS_PAPER?paper.?paper rdfs:label?paper_label. }}$ 

However, please note that this answer is not a numerical value, but a SPARQL query.
