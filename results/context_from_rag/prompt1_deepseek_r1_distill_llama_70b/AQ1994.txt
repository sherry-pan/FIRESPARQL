Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question using the given context. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the HRLRE model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context provided. The context has several RDF triples from an ORKG dump. Each triple has a subject, predicate, and object. The subjects are URIs like http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211473, and the predicates include things like rdfs:label, rdf:type, etc.

I need to extract entities and properties mentioned in the question. The main entity here is "HRLRE model" and the properties would be related to papers and their code links. 

Looking through the context, I see several resources labeled as "Paper". For example, R211524 is a Paper with the label "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire". Similarly, R211922 is another Paper titled "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)". There's also R211327, which is a Paper but without a specific label provided in the context.

I don't see any mention of "HRLRE model" in the context. So, none of the papers listed here explicitly mention using the HRLRE model. Therefore, there are no papers in the provided data that have utilized the HRLRE model.

Additionally, the context doesn't provide any information about code links for these papers. So, even if there were papers using HRLRE, there's no data on where to find their code.

Since the context doesn't contain any relevant information about the HRLRE model or code links, the result is an empty list.

The given context does not contain any information related to the "HRLRE model" or papers that utilized it. Therefore, there are no relevant papers or code links to provide.
