Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the AAPD dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/#>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/#>
    SELECT?title?id 
    WHERE {
     ?paper a orkgr:ResearchPaper.
     ?paper orkgc:hasTitle?title.
     ?paper orkgc:hasId?id.
     ?paper orkgc:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
     ?benchmark orkgp:hasDataset?dataset.
     ?dataset a orkgr:AAPD_dataset.
      FILTER (?benchmark IS NOT NULL).
    }
    ```<|eot_id|>
