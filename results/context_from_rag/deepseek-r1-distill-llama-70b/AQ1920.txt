Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question about papers using the Funnel Transformer model and their code links. Let me start by understanding the question. The user is asking for a list of papers that have used the Funnel Transformer and wants the code links. 

Looking at the JSON, each entry has a property IRI and a label. I need to find properties that relate to papers, models, and code. 

First, "has implementation" seems relevant because it likely points to where the model is implemented, which could include code links. Next, "method" is important because the Funnel Transformer is a method used in papers. 

I should also consider "evaluation" since papers often evaluate their methods, and "dataset" because they might use specific datasets. "Approach" is another good fit as it describes the methodology. 

Additionally, "has benchmark" could be useful as benchmarks are often used to evaluate models. "has dataset" might help identify which datasets were used with the model. 

I think these properties together would help in identifying the relevant papers and their implementations. I'll list them with brief explanations for each.
