Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of 1-of-100 Accuracy metric on the PolyAI Reddit benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset?accuracy
WHERE {
 ?model rdfs:label "SVM".
 ?dataset rdfs:label "MNIST".
 ?model a orkgc:Model.
 ?dataset a orkgc:Dataset.
 ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?dataset.
 ?model orkgp:HAS_VALUE?accuracy.
  FILTER (STR(?accuracy) = "0.939"^^xsd:float).
}
```    Note: The provided RDF data dump is not included here as it is not provided in the prompt. It is assumed to be available elsewhere. 

    Please note that the above SPARQL query is a simplified example and may need to be modified based on the actual RDF data dump. The query is designed to retrieve the model, dataset, and accuracy value that match the input question. The query uses the `rdfs:label` property to match the model and dataset names, and the `orkgp:HAS_MODEL` and `orkgp:HAS_VALUE` properties to match the model and accuracy value. The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include the accuracy value that matches the value "0.939".
