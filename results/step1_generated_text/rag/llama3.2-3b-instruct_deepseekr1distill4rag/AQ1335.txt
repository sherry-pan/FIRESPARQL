Question:
What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the Yelp-14 dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?metric?value
WHERE {
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasBenchmarkResult?result.
 ?result ora:achievedOn?dataset.
 ?result ora:hasMetric?metric.
 ?metric ora:hasValue?value.
  FILTER (str(?metric) = "validation research" OR str(?metric) = "technique").
  BIND (str(?value) AS?valueStr).
  BIND (str(?metric) AS?metricStr).
  FILTER (str(?valueStr) = "93.9").
  BIND (CONCAT(?metricStr, ":",?valueStr) AS?metricValue).
  FILTER (str(?metricValue) = "validation research 93.9" OR str(?metricValue) = "technique 93.9").
}
```    Note: The output is a SPARQL query that can be executed on the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) to retrieve the answer to the input question. The query is based on the provided context and the extracted terms from the input question. The query uses the RDF prefixes and structure specified in the context. The query retrieves the metric and its value for the highest benchmark result achieved on the Yelp-14 dataset, including the metric and its value. The query filters the results to include only the metric and its value for "validation research" or "technique" and the value "93.9". The query returns the metric and its value as a string in the format "metric:value".
