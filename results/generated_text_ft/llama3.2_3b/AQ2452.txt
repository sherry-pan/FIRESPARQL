Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the AxCell model for benchmarking purposes?

    Explanation: The SPARQL query first identifies papers that have used the AxCell model for benchmarking purposes. 
                 It then filters the code references from these papers to get the papers that have used the AxCell model for benchmarking purposes. 
                 The query is ordered by the number of code references in descending order and returns the top 10 results. 
                 The actual Wikidata entities should be replaced with the actual entity URIs. 
                 The query assumes that the code references are listed in the "code_references" property. 
                 The query assumes that the AxCell model used is listed in the "model_used" property and the benchmarking purposes are listed in the "benchmarking_purposes" property.

    I can help with that. Here is the SPARQL query:
