Question:
What is the most common lead compound?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?resource?resource_lbl (COUNT(?score) AS?score_count) 
WHERE {
 ?resource orkgp:P31?class.
  FILTER(REGEX(STR(?resource_lbl), "compound", "i"))
 ?score orkgp:P312?resource.
  BIND(XSD:float(?score) AS?score)
  BIND(XSD:float(?score) + 0.5 AS?score)
}
GROUP BY?resource?resource_lbl
ORDER BY DESC(?score_count)
LIMIT 5
``` 
    Note: The above SPARQL query is a simplified representation of the steps taken in the provided context. The query is designed to retrieve the top 5 resources that are most similar to the input question, "What is the most common lead compound?" The query filters resources that contain the term "compound" in their labels, calculates a score based on the relevance of each resource's label, and returns the top 5 resources with the highest scores. 

    This query is based on the assumption that the input question is asking for the most common lead compound, and the query is designed to retrieve the top 5 resources that are most similar to this concept. 

    The query uses the following variables:
    -?resource: The URI of the resource.
    -?resource_lbl: The label of the resource.
    -?score: The score of the resource.
    -?score_count: The count of resources with the same score.
    The query uses the following predicates:
    - orkgp:P31: The class of the resource.
    - orkgp:P312: The score of the resource.
    The query uses the following filters:
    - REGEX(STR(?resource_lbl), "compound", "i"): Filters resources that contain the term "compound" in their labels.
    - XSD:float(?score) + 0.5: Assigns a default score of 0.5 to resources that do not contain the term "compound" in their labels. 
    The query uses the following group and order clauses:
    - GROUP BY?resource?resource_lbl: Groups the results by resource and label.
    - ORDER BY DESC(?score_count): Orders the results by the count of resources with the same score in descending order.
    - LIMIT 5: Limits the results to the top 5 resources. 

    This query is designed to retrieve the top 5 resources that are most similar to the input question, "What is the most common lead compound?" The query is based on the assumption that the input question is asking for the most common lead compound, and the query is designed to retrieve the top 5 resources that are most similar to this concept. 

    The query is based on the following steps:
    1. Filter resources that contain the term "compound" in their labels.
    2. Assign a score to each resource based on its relevance to the input question.
    3. Return the top 5 resources with the highest scores.
