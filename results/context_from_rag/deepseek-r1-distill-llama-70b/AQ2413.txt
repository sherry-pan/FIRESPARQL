Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question about papers using the CvT-21 (384 res) model and their code links. Let me start by understanding the question. The user is asking for a list of papers that have used a specific model and wants links to their code. 

Looking at the JSON example, I see properties related to various aspects like methods, datasets, evaluations, etc. The question is about papers and their implementations, so I should focus on properties that relate to papers, implementations, and code.

First, I notice the property "HAS_IMPLEMENTATION" with the label "implementation". This seems relevant because it likely points to where the model is implemented, which could include code links.

Next, "HAS_METHOD" labeled "method" is also important because it refers to the specific method or model used in the paper, which in this case is the CvT-21 model.

The property "HAS_DATASET" might be useful if the papers used specific datasets with the model, but it's not directly about the code. However, datasets can sometimes link to implementations.

"evaluation" from "HAS_EVALUATION" could be relevant because papers often provide evaluations of their models, and those sections might mention or link to code repositories.

"implementation" again appears as a label, so it's another point to consider for code links.

"method" is another instance of the same property as "HAS_METHOD", reinforcing its relevance.

"approach" from "HAS_APPROACH" is also related because it describes the method used, which is the CvT-21 model.

Lastly, "has benchmark" from "HAS_BENCHMARK" might be useful if the papers benchmarked the model against others, potentially leading to implementation details.

So, compiling these, the most relevant properties are those related to implementation, method, dataset, evaluation, approach, and benchmark. Each of these can help in identifying where the model is used and how to access the code.
