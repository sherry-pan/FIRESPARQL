Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the Fine-Grained Gating model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    SELECT?paper?code
    WHERE {
   ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER orkgr:R44243.
   ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
    FILTER (strcontains( str(?paper), 'Fine-Grained Gating model') ) 
    FILTER (strcontains( str(?code), 'benchmark') )
    }
    ```



## Step 1: Identify the key terms and concepts from the input question.
The key terms and concepts from the input question are "Fine-Grained Gating model", "code", "papers", and "benchmark".

## Step 2: Match the key terms and concepts with the candidates provided in the context.
From the context, we can see that the candidates include:
- "Fine-Grained Gating model" with a URI "orkgr:R44243"
- "code" with a predicate "orkgp:HAS_CODE"
- "papers" with a predicate "orkgp:HAS_PAPER"
- "benchmark" with a predicate "orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK"

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query based on the matched terms and concepts.
We need to query the ORKG to find papers that benchmark the "Fine-Grained Gating model" and have code. The query should filter papers that contain the phrase "Fine-Grained Gating model" and code that contain the word "benchmark".

## Step 4: Write the SPARQL query.
The SPARQL query is:
```sparql
SELECT?paper?code
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER orkgr:R44243.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
  FILTER (strcontains( str(?paper), 'Fine-Grained Gating model') ) 
  FILTER (strcontains( str(?code), 'benchmark') )
}
```

The final answer is: 
```sparql
SELECT?paper?code
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER orkgr:R44243.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
  FILTER (strcontains( str(?paper), 'Fine-Grained Gating model') ) 
  FILTER (strcontains( str(?code), 'benchmark') )
}
