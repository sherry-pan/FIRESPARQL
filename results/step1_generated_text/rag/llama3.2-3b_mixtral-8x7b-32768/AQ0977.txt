Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Amazon-2 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
     PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkg/citations/>
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkg/predicates/>
     SELECT?metric?model
     WHERE {
       ?metric orkg:relatedTo?model.
       ?model orkg:hasEvaluation?metric.
        FILTER (lang(?metric) = 'en')
        FILTER (lang(?model) = 'en')
    } 
    END


```

This code snippet is a part of a larger system that generates SPARQL queries from natural language questions. The code defines a set of prefixes for the ORKG, a semantic knowledge graph, and then generates a SPARQL query based on the input question and provided context. The query is designed to retrieve the evaluation metrics and benchmarking models commonly used when benchmarking models on the Amazon-2 dataset.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1.  **Prefix declarations**: The code starts with prefix declarations for the ORKG, ORKG, and ORKGP namespaces. These prefixes allow the query to reference specific URIs and labels in the knowledge graph.
2.  **SELECT clause**: The SELECT clause specifies the variables that will be retrieved in the query. In this case, we're retrieving the evaluation metrics (`?metric`) and benchmarking models (`?model`).
3.  **WHERE clause**: The WHERE clause defines the conditions under which the query will return results. It consists of three parts:

    *   `?metric orkg:relatedTo?model.`: This line connects evaluation metrics to benchmarking models by stating that an evaluation metric is related to a benchmarking model.
    *   `?model orkg:hasEvaluation?metric.`: This line connects benchmarking models to evaluation metrics by stating that a benchmarking model has an evaluation metric.
    *   `FILTER (lang(?metric) = 'en')` and `FILTER (lang(?model) = 'en')`: These lines filter the results to only include evaluation metrics and benchmarking models with labels in English.
4.  **END**: The END keyword marks the end of the SPARQL query.

Overall, this code snippet demonstrates how to generate a SPARQL query from a natural language question and provided context, and how to use the ORKG knowledge graph to retrieve relevant information.<|eot_id|>
