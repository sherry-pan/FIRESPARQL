Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the HRLRE model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information to find any mentions of the HRLRE model. Scanning the RDF data, I see that the context includes information about papers, their authors, venues, and some methods or techniques. However, I don't see any direct mention of "HRLRE" in the provided data. 

The context includes two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a method involving steps for named entity recognition, using techniques like SciBERT and k-means. R284316 talks about a paper titled "validation research" that deals with extracting entity knowledge using a model called jpark. Neither of these seems related to HRLRE.

Since there's no explicit mention of HRLRE, I can't extract any relevant papers or code links from the given data. Therefore, the answer should reflect that no relevant information was found in the context.

Given the context provided, there is no mention of the HRLRE model or any associated papers. Therefore, no relevant information can be retrieved from the context.
