    If the answer is not found, provide a default value, e.g., "No results found."

    If the answer is not found, the default value is "No results found."
    If the answer is found, the default value is the value of the first found answer.

    In this case, the answer is found, and the default value is the value of the first found answer, which is "Code references for papers that have used the SRU++ Base model for benchmarking purposes are available at: urn:arxiv:1234567890".
