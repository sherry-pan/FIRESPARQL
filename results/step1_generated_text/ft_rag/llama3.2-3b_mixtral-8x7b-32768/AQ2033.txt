Question:
List the code links in papers that use the Unsupervised NMT + weight-sharing model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code_links
     WHERE {
      ?papers      orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK      ?benchmark.
       FILTER (str(?benchmark) = "Benchmark MPQA")
      ?papers      orkgp:P31             ?papers.
      ?papers      orkgp:HAS_CODE_LINK     ?code_links.
      ?code_links      rdfs:label              ?code_links_labels.
       FILTER (str(?code_links_labels) = "Contribution 1")
      ?papers      orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
       FILTER (str(?model) = "Unsupervised NMT + weight-sharing")
      ?model      rdfs:label              ?model_labels.
       FILTER (str(?model_labels) = "captures the meaning of the correlation between words based on multi-head attention")
      ?papers      orkgp:P31             ?papers.
     } 
    SELECT?code_links
    WHERE {
      ?papers      orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK      ?benchmark.
       FILTER (str(?benchmark) = "Benchmark MPQA")
      ?papers      orkgp:P31             ?papers.
      ?papers      orkgp:HAS_CODE_LINK     ?code_links.
      ?code_links      rdfs:label              ?code_links_labels.
       FILTER (str(?code_links_labels) = "Contribution 1")
      ?papers      orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
       FILTER (str(?model) = "Unsupervised NMT + weight-sharing")
      ?model      rdfs:label              ?model_labels.
       FILTER (str(?model_labels) = "captures the meaning of the correlation between words based on multi-head attention")

     } 
    Note that the filter condition `str(?model_labels) = "captures the meaning of the correlation between words based on multi-head attention"` is repeated twice in the query. The filter condition `str(?benchmark) = "Benchmark MPQA"` is also repeated twice in the query. This is an artifact of the query generation process and does not affect the correctness of the generated query. 

    This SPARQL query should be executed to retrieve the code links in papers that use the Unsupervised NMT + weight-sharing model in any benchmark. 
    The retrieved code links are expected to be the code links that appear in papers that use the
