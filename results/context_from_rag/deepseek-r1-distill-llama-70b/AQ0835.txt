Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the enwik8 benchmark dataset. The question is about listing the metrics used, so I should focus on properties related to evaluation, benchmarks, and metrics.

First, I'll look through the JSON properties. The "evaluation" label seems directly related because it's about assessing model performance. Then, "Accuracy" is a common metric, so that's a good fit. "Recall" and the F1 scores (both micro and macro) are standard evaluation metrics across different datasets, including benchmarks like enwik8.

I also notice properties like "has benchmark" and "has dataset," which might be relevant because enwik8 is a benchmark dataset. However, the question specifically asks for metrics, so I'll prioritize the ones that are actual evaluation measures. "Avg words" and "Avg Length" could relate to text-based metrics, which enwik8 might use since it's a text compression dataset.

I should make sure each selected property is clearly tied to evaluating models. So, I'll include "evaluation," "Accuracy," "Recall," "micro-F1," "macro-F1," "Avg words," and "Avg Length." Each of these provides a different aspect of model performance, covering both accuracy and text-specific metrics.
