Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PNDec model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    SELECT DISTINCT?code
    WHERE {
     ?paper orkgp:P31?contrib.
     ?contrib orkgp:P32?cont.
     ?cont orkgp:P33?model.
     ?model rdfs:label?model_lbl.
      FILTER(REGEX(?model_lbl, "PNDec"))
     ?cont orkgp:P34?cont_lbl.
     ?cont_lbl rdfs:label?cont_lbl_lbl.
     ?cont_lbl orkgp:P35?cont_code.
     ?cont_code rdfs:label?code.
     ?contrib orkgp:P36?cont.
     ?cont orkgp:P37?cont_cmp.
     ?cont_cmp rdfs:label?cont_cmp_lbl.
     ?cont_cmp orkgp:P38?cont_eval.
     ?cont_eval rdfs:label?eval_lbl.
     ?eval_lbl orkgp:P39?cont_eval_lbl.
     ?cont_eval_lbl orkgp:P40?cont_eval_benchmark.
     ?cont_eval_benchmark rdfs:label?benchmark_lbl.
      FILTER(REGEX(?benchmark_lbl, "benchmarking"))
    }
```    .sparql

This query starts by selecting the `?code` variable. It then filters papers (`?paper`) that have a contribution (`?contrib`) with a model (`?model`) labeled with "PNDec". It then filters the contributions (`?cont`) that have a code (`?cont_code`) labeled with a label that matches the benchmarking label. Finally, it filters the code references (`?code`) based on the presence of a benchmarking label. 

The query uses various properties from the ORKG RDF data, such as `orkgp:P31`, `orkgp:P32`, `orkgp:P33`, `orkgp:P34`, `orkgp:P35`, `orkgp:P36`, `orkgp:P37`, `orkgp:P38`, `orkgp:P39`, and `orkgp:P40`, to link the entities together. 

The `FILTER(REGEX(?model_lbl, "PNDec"))` and `FILTER(REGEX(?benchmark_lbl, "benchmarking"))` clauses are used to filter the results based on the presence of the "PNDec" and "benchmarking" labels, respectively. 

The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to return only unique values for the `?code` variable. 

Note that this query assumes that the `?cont_eval_benchmark_lbl` variable is a label that matches the benchmarking label. If this is not the case, the query may need to be modified accordingly. 

Also, note that the `REGEX` function is used to match the labels against the "PNDec" and "benchmarking" patterns. This may not work correctly for all cases, and the query may need to be modified to use a different matching function or approach. 

Finally, note that the query uses a very specific and narrow approach to find code references in papers that have used the PNDec model for benchmarking purposes. The query may need to be modified or extended to accommodate more general or flexible approaches. 

To test this query, you can use a SPARQL query execution engine such as the SPARQL API or the Py2Neo library. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to clarify or modify anything in the query. 

    context begins---------

Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this question using the provided ORKG RDF data. The question is asking where to find code references in papers that have used the PNDec model for benchmarking. 

First, I should extract the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The main terms here are "code references," "papers," "PNDec model," and "benchmarking purposes." 

Looking through the context, I see several resources related to papers and contributions. For example, R75430 is a Venue labeled "IBM Journal of Research and Development," and R75431 is a Contribution labeled "Contribution 1." There's also R76244, which is a Contribution labeled "Team 2 Subtask 1 English." 

I need to find entities that are related to papers and benchmarking. R75840 is a Comparison labeled "Factors influencing evidence-based decision-making in humanitarian response," which might be related to benchmarking. R75841 is a Paper, but its label isn't provided, so it's unclear. 

R162991 is a Paper titled "Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study," and R162992 is the Venue for that paper. R162993 is another Contribution. R163201 is a Comparison about Wikipedia-based Named Entity Recognition. 

Since the question is about code references in papers using PNDec for benchmarking, I'm looking for papers or contributions that discuss models and benchmarking. R75431 and R162993 are both Contributions, which might be relevant. R75840 and R163201 are Comparisons
