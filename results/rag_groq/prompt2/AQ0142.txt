Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the MultiNLI dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "models" and "MultiNLI dataset". The property connecting them is "evaluated on". So, I need to look for these terms in the context.

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, in the first part, there's a resource R147652 which has steps involving models like SVM and datasets like MNIST. This might be relevant because it mentions models and datasets, which are the key terms in the question.

Next, I'll compute the similarity between the extracted terms and the entities in the RDF data. The term "models" would match with any resource that's classified as a model, such as SVM or other machine learning models mentioned. The term "MultiNLI dataset" isn't directly mentioned, but MNIST is, so maybe there's a close dataset in the context.

I also notice that there's a resource R284316 which is a journal article about extracting entity knowledge using models like Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight. These could be models evaluated on some datasets, possibly including MultiNLI or similar ones.

Since the context doesn't explicitly mention MultiNLI, I'll have to infer based on similar datasets. MNIST is a dataset for images, but maybe there's another dataset in the context that's closer to NLI tasks. Alternatively, I can consider that the models mentioned (like SVM) have been evaluated on datasets, even if not explicitly MultiNLI.

I'll then select the top candidates. For "models", SVM and other mentioned models like CRF algorithm are likely candidates. For "MultiNLI dataset", since it's not present, I'll look for the closest match, which might be the MNIST dataset or any other dataset mentioned in the context.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their top candidates, ensuring the URIs and types are correctly formatted using the specified prefixes.
