Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the Shake-Shake (SAM) model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information. The context has two main sections from the ORKG RDF dump. The first part describes a research process with five steps, and the second part talks about a journal article titled "validation research" with some authors and a DOI link.

I'm looking for mentions of the Shake-Shake (SAM) model. Scanning through the context, I don't see any direct references to "Shake-Shake" or "SAM" in the provided triples. The first section discusses a method involving NER and CRF algorithms, and the second section is about entity knowledge extraction using models like Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight, but not Shake-Shake.

Since there's no information about the Shake-Shake model in the context, I can't extract any relevant papers or code links from it. Therefore, the answer should indicate that no relevant information was found in the provided data.

The provided context does not contain any information related to the Shake-Shake (SAM) model or papers that utilized it. Therefore, no relevant papers or code links can be extracted from the given data.
