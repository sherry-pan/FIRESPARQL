Question:
For what piezoresistive material the least response time was obtained?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?material
     WHERE {
    ?material orkgp:P43156?response_time.
    ?response_time rdfs:label?response_time_labels.
     BIND(xsd:float(?response_time_labels) AS?response_time_value).
    ?material orkgp:P18?least_response_time.
     FILTER (?response_time_value = (min(?response_time_value))).
     }<|eot_id|>
