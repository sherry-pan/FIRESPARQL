Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the DeiT-Ti model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:

    Note: This problem requires you to generate a SPARQL query based on the provided context and question. You can use the context to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG. 

    Here is the solution:
```

SELECT?p?o 
WHERE {
 ?p a ora:Paper.
 ?p ora:hasCode?o.
 ?p ora:usedDeiT-Ti?m.
 ?m ora:hasEvaluation?e.
 ?e ora:evaluationType ora:benchmarking.
 ?o ora:hasModel?m.
}
```
Note: The above SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context and question. It is assumed that the entities and properties in the ORKG are correctly linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question. 

Please let me know if you need any further clarification or details. 

The final answer is $\boxed{SELECT?p?o  WHERE {?p a ora:Paper.?p ora:hasCode?o.?p ora:usedDeiT-Ti?m.?m ora:hasEvaluation?e.?e ora:evaluationType ora:benchmarking.?o ora:hasModel?m. }}$. 

(Note: I've added the answer in the box as requested)
