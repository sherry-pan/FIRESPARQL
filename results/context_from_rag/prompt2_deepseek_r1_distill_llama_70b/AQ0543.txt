Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Cart Pole (OpenAI Gym) dataset. 

First, I'll look through the context information to find any relevant data. The context includes RDF data from two files. I'll start by examining each resource and its properties.

Looking at the first file, I see resources like R147652, which describes a method involving steps for NER. It mentions datasets like MNIST and models like SVM. However, there's no mention of the Cart Pole dataset here.

In the second file, resource R284316 discusses a journal article about extracting entity knowledge using NLP techniques. It mentions datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP, but again, no Cart Pole. The authors and publication details are provided, but not relevant to the Cart Pole.

I also check for any properties related to benchmarking or datasets. The predicates include things like P39020, which describes steps, and others like P27 for authors, but nothing specific to benchmarking on Cart Pole.

Since the context doesn't contain any information about the Cart Pole dataset or any papers benchmarking models on it, I can't extract any relevant terms or candidates. Therefore, the candidates list will be empty for each extracted term.
