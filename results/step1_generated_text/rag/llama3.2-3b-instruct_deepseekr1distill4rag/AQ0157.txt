What models are being evaluated on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset?

 ?m ora:evaluatedOn?d.
  FILTER (str(?d) = "MNIST" OR str(?d) = "Penn Treebank (Character Level)" ).
}
``` 
    Note: The actual SPARQL query might need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data and the structure of the Open Research Knowledge Graph. The above SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context and the output JSON.<|eot_id|>
