Okay, so I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question: "What are the metrics of evaluation over the ObjectNet dataset?" 

First, I should understand what the question is asking. It's about evaluation metrics used on the ObjectNet dataset. So, I'm looking for properties related to evaluation, metrics, or assessments.

Looking at the JSON example provided, I see a list of properties with their labels. I need to go through each one and see if it relates to evaluation or metrics.

Starting from the top, the first few properties like "affects", "causes", "coexists with", etc., don't seem relevant. They're more about relationships rather than evaluation.

Then I come across "evaluation" with the label "evaluation". That seems directly relevant because the question is about evaluation metrics. So this property is a good match.

Next, I see "has benchmark" which is about benchmarks. Benchmarks are often used in evaluations to measure performance, so this is also relevant.

There's "Accuracy" which is a common evaluation metric. It measures how accurate a model is, so that's definitely relevant.

"Recall" is another metric that's important in evaluations, especially in classification tasks. It measures how well a model recalls instances of a particular class.

"macro-F1" and "micro-F1" are F1 scores, which are used to evaluate the performance of classification models. They combine precision and recall, making them crucial metrics.

"micro-F1" is similar but calculated differently, so it's also relevant.

"NDCG@10" stands for Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 10, which is used to evaluate ranking quality. It's a metric, so it fits.

"has classes" might be relevant because knowing the number of classes can affect evaluation metrics, but it's more about the dataset structure than the metrics themselves.

"number of type" could relate to the types of metrics used, but it's a bit vague.

"has training set" and "validation set" are about data splits, which are part of the evaluation process, so they're somewhat relevant.

"has uncertainty value" and "has uncertainty unit" relate to the precision of evaluations, so they could be useful.

"CO2 footprint process" seems unrelated to evaluation metrics, so I can skip that.

"Token per News" doesn't seem relevant here.

"Risk types" and "Types of riks" are about risks, not directly about evaluation metrics.

"Quantitative methods" is a broad term but could relate to how evaluations are conducted.

"Plane" and "Controller" don't seem relevant.

"method" is relevant because evaluation methods are part of the process.

"iteration" could relate to how many times an evaluation was performed.

"data splitting method" is about how data is divided into training and testing sets, which affects evaluation.

"reporting level" could be about the granularity of evaluation results.

"knowledge graph name" and others related to knowledge graphs don't seem directly relevant.

"property of the dataset" is about dataset characteristics, which might include evaluation metrics.

"dataset annotation type" is about how data is annotated, which can influence evaluation.

"split into" and "splitting technique" relate to data division for evaluation.

"tabular dataset" is a type of dataset, not a metric.

"column entity annotation" and similar properties are about data structure, not metrics.

"matching strategy", "system module", "table selection technique", "label generation technique" are more about methods than metrics.

"city", "PM25_prcnt_change" are specific to environmental data, not relevant here.

"lesson learned" is about insights, not metrics.

"# core participant", "# table", etc., are counts, which might be part of evaluation but not metrics themselves.

"Aligned with FAIR principles" is about data principles, not metrics.

"# classes" again is about dataset structure.

"has training set" and "validation set" are about data splits.

"has uncertainty value" and "unit" relate to evaluation precision.

"third prize comment" and others like it are about competition results, not metrics.

"# DBpedia properties", "# Schema.org property" are about data sources, not metrics.

So, compiling all the relevant properties, I have several that relate to evaluation, metrics, and the process around them. Each of these properties can help in understanding how the ObjectNet dataset is evaluated, what metrics are used, and the methods behind the evaluation process.
