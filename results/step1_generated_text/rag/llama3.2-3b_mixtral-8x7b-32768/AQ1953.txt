Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the CL-Titles-Parser model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/orkgc#>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/orkgp#>
SELECT?paper?code 
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?p1.
 ?p1 orkgp:UTILIZES?p2.
 ?p2 orkgp:UTILIZES orkgc:CL-Titles-Parser_model.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
}
``` 
    Note: The provided SPARQL query is just a sample query and may need to be adjusted according to the actual structure of the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG).
    The SPARQL query is generated based on the input question and the provided context. 

    The query first selects papers that have utilized the CL-Titles-Parser model. Then, it filters out only those papers that have links to their code. 

    This query is based on the assumption that the papers that have utilized the CL-Titles-Parser model and have links to their code will be linked to by the 'papers' entity, the 'utilized' property, and the 'CL-Titles-Parser model' entity in the ORKG. 

    The query may need to be adjusted according to the actual structure of the ORKG. 

    The query may also need to be further optimized for better performance.
