Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the IMDb-M benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model a ora:Model.
 ?model ora:testOn?dataset.
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
  FILTER (str(?dataset) = "IMDb-M_benchmark_dataset")
}
``` 
    This SPARQL query returns a list of models that have been tested on the IMDb-M benchmark dataset. It first identifies the models that have the property "testOn" and then filters the results to only include models that have been tested on the IMDb-M benchmark dataset. 

    The query uses the `ora:Model` and `ora:Dataset` classes to identify models and datasets, respectively. It also uses the `ora:testOn` property to link models to the datasets they have been tested on. The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include models that have been tested on the IMDb-M benchmark dataset. 

    The `str(?dataset) = "IMDb-M_benchmark_dataset"` condition is used to filter the results to only include models that have been tested on the IMDb-M benchmark dataset. This is done by converting the dataset URI to a string and comparing it to the desired string. 

    The query returns a list of models and datasets that have been tested on the IMDb-M benchmark dataset. Each row in the output contains a model and the dataset it has been tested on. 

    Example output:
    ```
   ?model?dataset
    ---+--------------------------------
    SVM  ora:IMDb-M_benchmark_dataset
    CRF algorithm ora:IMDb-M_benchmark_dataset
    ``` 
    This output shows the models that have been tested on the IMDb-M benchmark dataset. The first row shows the model "SVM" and the dataset it has been tested on, which is the IMDb-M benchmark dataset. The second row shows the model "CRF algorithm" and the dataset it has been tested on, which is also the IMDb-M benchmark dataset. 

    Note that this output is just an example and may not reflect the actual output of the query. The actual output will depend on the data in the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    To run this query, you will need to use a SPARQL query engine such as SPARQL Query Language (SPARQL) or Jena. You will need to replace the `ora` namespace with the actual namespace used in the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Here is an example of how you can run this query using Jena:
    ```java
import org.apache.jena.arq.query.Builder;
import org.apache.jena.arq.query.QueryLanguage;
import org.apache.jena.graph.Graph;
import org.apache.jena.graph.Node;
import org.apache.jena.query.Query;
import org.apache.jena.query.QueryLanguage;
import org.apache.jena.query.QuerySolution;
import org.apache.jena.query.ResultSet;
import org.apache.jena.query.ResultSetBuilderFactory;
import org.apache.jena.query.QuerySolutionMap;
import org.apache.jena.rdf.model.Model;
import org.apache.jena.rdf.model.ModelFactory;
import org.apache.jena.rdf.model.RDFNode;
import org.apache.jena.rdf.model.Resource;

public class SPARQLQuery {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Load the ORKG RDF data dump
    Model model = ModelFactory.createDefaultModel();
    // Add the RDF data to the model
    //...

    // Create a SPARQL query
    Query query = Builder.createQuery(
        "SELECT?model?dataset\n"
        + "WHERE {\n"
        + " ?model a ora:Model.\n"
        + " ?model ora:testOn?dataset.\n"
        + " ?dataset a ora:Dataset.\n"
        + "  FILTER (str(?dataset) = \"IMDb-M_benchmark_dataset\")\n"
        + "}\n"
    );

    // Execute the query
    ResultSet results = model.query(query).execute();

    // Print the results
    while (results.hasNext()) {
      QuerySolution solution = results.next();
      RDFNode model = solution.get("?model");
      RDFNode dataset = solution.get("?dataset");
      System.out.println(model.toString() + " " + dataset.toString());
    }
  }
}
``` 
    This code loads the ORKG RDF data dump, creates a SPARQL query, executes the query, and prints the results. The `ora` namespace is replaced with the actual namespace used in the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Note that this is just an example and may not reflect the actual code used to run the query. The actual code will depend on the specific requirements of the query and the data in the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    To run this query, you will need to have the Jena library installed and configured properly. You will also need to replace the `ora` namespace with the actual namespace used in the ORKG RDF data dump.
