Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the DQN-PixelCNN model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P31 [
         rdfs:label?title
       ];
        orkgp:P32 [
         orkgp:HAS_IMPLEMENTATION?impl
        ?impl orkgp:P5043?code
        ];
        orkgp:P5042?method.
       FILTER(REGEX(STR(?method), "DQN-PixelCNN"))
     }<|eot_id|>
