Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user is asking for a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Walker, walk (DMControl100k) dataset. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any relevant information. The context includes several RDF triples from ORKG. I see that there are two main resources mentioned: R147652 and R283709, R283710. 

Looking at R147652, it describes a method with several steps, but I don't see any direct mention of the Walker dataset or DMControl100k. The steps involve expanding seed terms, annotating data, applying NER, etc. So, this might not be directly relevant.

Next, R283709 and R283710 seem to describe a journal article. R283709 has properties like "Graph analytics", "Horizon 2020", etc., but again, no mention of the Walker dataset. R283710 lists authors and publication details but nothing related to the specific dataset.

I also notice that the context includes information about the number of projects, organizations, and deliverables, but nothing about the Walker or DMControl100k datasets. 

Since the context doesn't provide any specific data about the Walker dataset or the DMControl100k, I can't extract any relevant entities or properties. Therefore, the candidates for the extracted terms will be empty. 

I should structure the JSON response as per the example, but since there's no relevant data, the candidates will be empty arrays. I'll make sure to use the correct RDF prefixes and structure the JSON properly, even if the results are empty.
