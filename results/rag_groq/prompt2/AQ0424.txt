Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the WMT2014 German-English dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "research papers" and "WMT2014 German-English dataset". The action is "contain a benchmark over", which suggests a relationship between the papers and the dataset.

Looking at the context information, I see two main resources: R147246 and R284317. Both are papers with various properties. R147246 has authors like Ligia Sierra, Betty L LÃ³pez, Flavio Forni, Maria Angela Vandelli, Michele Zoli, and Antonietta Vilella, published in 2015. R284317 is from 2021 with authors Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta, and it's about extracting entity knowledge from text using models like jpark.

Now, I need to find which of these papers mention a benchmark over the WMT2014 dataset. The WMT2014 dataset is a specific one, so I'm looking for any mention of it in the paper's metadata or content. 

Looking at R147246, the context doesn't explicitly mention WMT2014. It talks about methods involving SVM and MNIST, which are more related to image classification, not machine translation datasets like WMT. So this paper might not be relevant.

R284317, on the other hand, discusses NLP tasks, specifically entity recognition and linking. The paper mentions using datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP, but not WMT2014. However, since it's about NLP and benchmarks, it's possible that the paper could be related, but without explicit mention of WMT2014, it's a stretch.

Wait, maybe I missed something. The question is about benchmarks over WMT2014. The context doesn't provide any direct links to WMT2014, so perhaps neither of these papers is directly relevant. But since the task is to list based on the provided data, I have to work with what's given.

Alternatively, maybe the term "benchmark" in the question refers to any evaluation on a dataset. R284317 does mention evaluation using several datasets, but not WMT2014. R147246 doesn't mention any datasets related to WMT.

So, based on the provided data, there's no paper that explicitly uses the WMT2014 German-English dataset. Therefore, the answer might be that there are no matching papers in the given context.

But wait, the user expects a JSON output with titles and IDs. Since there's no match, the candidates would be empty. However, the example provided in the query shows that even if there's no direct match, some papers might still be considered based on general relevance.

Alternatively, perhaps I should consider that "benchmark" could relate to any evaluation, so R284317, which discusses model evaluation, might be a candidate, even without mentioning WMT2014.

In that case, I could include R284317 as a candidate, noting that while it doesn't specifically mention WMT2014, it's about benchmarks in NLP, which might be tangentially related.

So, the JSON would include R284317 with its title and ID, even if it's not a perfect match. R147246 doesn't seem relevant at all, so it's excluded.

I think that's the best I can do with the given data. The answer will list R284317 as the only candidate, even though it's not a direct match, because it's the closest in terms of discussing benchmarks and NLP tasks.
