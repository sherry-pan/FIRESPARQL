Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the SciCite dataset, along with their titles and IDs. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of research papers and the SciCite dataset. From the context, I see several resources like R147246 and R283710, which are papers with authors and publication details. However, I don't see any direct mention of the SciCite dataset in the provided context. 

Since the context doesn't include information about the SciCite dataset, I can't extract any relevant papers related to it. Therefore, the candidates for "SciCite dataset" and "research papers" will be empty. 

I'll structure the JSON response as per the example, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including the appropriate URIs and types. Even though there are no matches, I'll still include the placeholders to maintain the structure.

```json
{
  "question": "Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the SciCite dataset?",
  "extracted_terms": {
    "research papers": [],
    "benchmarks": [],
    "SciCite dataset": []
  },
  "candidates": {
    "research papers": [],
    "benchmarks": [],
    "SciCite dataset": []
  }
}
```
