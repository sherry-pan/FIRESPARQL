Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the BCN+ELMo model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information. The context has two main sections from the ORKG RDF dump. The first part describes a research process with five steps, and the second part talks about a paper titled "validation research" with some authors and a DOI link.

I'm looking for any mention of the BCN+ELMo model. Scanning through the context, I don't see any references to BCN+ELMo. The models mentioned are SVM and methods like SciBERT, CRF, and some NER tools like Stanford NER and Flair NER. There's also a mention of jpark, YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata, but nothing about BCN+ELMo.

The papers listed in the context are R147246 and R284317. R147246 is from 2015 with multiple authors, and R284317 is from 2021 with authors Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta. Neither of these papers mention BCN+ELMo.

Since the context doesn't provide any information about the BCN+ELMo model or related papers, I can't extract any relevant entities or properties. Therefore, the candidates list would be empty because there's no data to match the query.

I should structure the answer according to the specified JSON format, but since there are no relevant terms or candidates, the extracted_terms and candidates sections will be empty.

```json
{
  "question": "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the BCN+ELMo model and include the links to their code?",
  "extracted_terms": [],
  "candidates": {}
}
