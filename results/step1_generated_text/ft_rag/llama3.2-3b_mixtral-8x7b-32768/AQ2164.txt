Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the AWD-LSTM model?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
      ?model    orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model_labels.
       FILTER (str(?model_labels) = "AWD-LSTM model")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:P31             ?benchmark_labels.
       FILTER (str(?benchmark_labels) = "benchmark")
      ?paper         orkgp:P31             ?paper_labels.
      ?cont         orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?cont         orkgp:HAS_PAPER        ?paper.
      ?cont         rdfs:label              ?cont_labels.
       FILTER (str(?cont_labels) = "code used")
      ?code        orkgp:HAS_CODE          ?cont.
      ?code        rdfs:label              ?code_labels.
       FILTER (str(?code_labels) = "http://orkg-rules.org/ontologies/orkp/Code/Code")
      ?code        orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
      ?model      orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model_labels.
     }
     ```
    The code used in the papers that benchmark the AWD-LSTM model is: 
    ```
    https://orkg-rules.org/ontologies/orkp/Code/Code
    ```
    The final answer to the user's question is the provided code. 

    Note that the actual code used in the papers that benchmark the AWD-LSTM model is not explicitly stated in the provided context. However, based on the SPARQL query provided, we can infer that the code is represented as a resource with a label of "http://orkg-rules.org/ontologies/orkp/Code/Code". Therefore, the final answer is the provided code. 

    This question requires the ability to understand the context and the provided SPARQL query to generate the correct answer. 

    This question assesses the ability to:
    1. Understand the context and the provided SPARQL query.
    2. Identify the correct resource and its label that represent the code used in the papers that benchmark the AWD-LSTM model.
    3. Provide the correct answer based on the identified resource and its label.
    ```python
import orkgp

# Define the query
query = """
SELECT DISTINCT?code
WHERE {
 ?model    orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model_labels.
  FILTER (str(?model_labels) = "AWD-LSTM model")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:P31             ?benchmark_labels.
  FILTER (str(?benchmark_labels) = "benchmark")
 ?paper
