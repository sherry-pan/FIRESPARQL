Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to answering the question: "Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the IMDb-M benchmark dataset?" 

First, I'll break down the question. It's asking for models tested on a specific dataset, IMDb-M. So, I'm looking for properties related to models, datasets, and evaluations or benchmarks.

Looking at the JSON example provided, I see properties like "has dataset", "evaluation", "method", etc. These seem relevant because they relate to datasets and evaluations. 

Now, considering the context file, I notice properties like "has training set", "validation set", "data splitting method", and "evaluation". These are all related to how datasets are used in model testing. 

I should also look for properties that might indicate benchmarking, such as "evaluation" or "benchmark". Additionally, properties like "method" could refer to the models or approaches used.

So, the most relevant properties would be those that connect models to datasets and their evaluations. This includes "has dataset", "evaluation", "method", and possibly "data splitting method" since it relates to how data is partitioned for testing.

I'll list these properties with their IRIs and explain why each is relevant. For example, "has dataset" directly links models to datasets, "evaluation" refers to the testing process, and "method" refers to the models themselves.
