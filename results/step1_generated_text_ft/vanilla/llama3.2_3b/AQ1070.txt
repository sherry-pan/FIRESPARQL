Question:
What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the FSNS - Test dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/schema/2015/11/orkg#>
     SELECT?metric?value 
     WHERE {?s orkg:hasBenchmarkResult?b 
            ?b orkg:hasDataset?d 
            ?d orkg:hasDataset?d2 
             FILTER (str(?d2) = "FSNS-Test") 
            ?b orkg:hasMetric?m 
            ?m orkg:hasMetricValue?v 
             FILTER (str(?m) = "highest") 
            ?m orkg:hasValue?v 
             FILTER (str(?v) = "value") 
             } 
     GROUP BY?m?v 
     HAVING COUNT(?s) > 1 
     ORDER BY DESC(?v) 
     LIMIT 1
