Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Macro Recall metric on the NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only) benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset?metric
WHERE {
 ?model a ora:Model.
 ?model ora:performedBestOn?dataset.
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset ora:isBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:hasMetric?metric.
 ?metric ora:hasLabel "Macro Recall".
 ?metric ora:hasUnit "metric".
  filter(?metric = ora:Macro_Recall_metric)
}
``` 
    Note: The SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG, getting correct answers to the input question. The query is based on the provided context and extracted terms. The query is optimized to retrieve the correct answer by filtering on the "Macro Recall metric" property and selecting the model, dataset, and metric that match the input question. 

    Note: The SPARQL query uses the following predicates:
    - `ora:Model` : represents a model
    - `ora:performedBestOn` : represents the model that performed best on a dataset
    - `ora:Dataset` : represents a dataset
    - `ora:isBenchmark` : represents a benchmark dataset
    - `ora:hasMetric` : represents a metric associated with a dataset
    - `ora:hasLabel` : represents a label associated with a metric
    - `ora:Macro_Recall_metric` : represents the Macro Recall metric property

    Note: The SPARQL query is designed to be executed on the ORKG RDF data dump, and the results will be the model, dataset, and metric that match the input question. 

    Note: The SPARQL query assumes that the ORKG RDF data dump contains the necessary data to answer the input question. If the data is not available, the query will not return any results. 

    Note: The SPARQL query is just one possible way to answer the input question, and there may be other queries that can also return the correct answer. 

    Note: The SPARQL query uses a filter to restrict the results to only those that match the "Macro Recall metric" property. This is done to ensure that only the correct answer is returned. 

    Note: The SPARQL query uses a filter to restrict the results to only those that have a label of "Macro Recall". This is done to ensure that only the correct answer is returned. 

    Note: The SPARQL query uses a filter to restrict the results to only those that have a unit of "metric". This is done to ensure that only the correct answer is returned.
