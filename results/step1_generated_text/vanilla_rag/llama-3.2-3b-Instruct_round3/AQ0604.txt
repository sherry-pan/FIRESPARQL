Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Atari 2600 Venture dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/>

     SELECT?title?id
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
      ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset "https://orkg.org/orkg/dataset/Atari_2600_Venture".
      ?paper orkg:titles?title.
      ?paper orkg:hasNumber?id.
      ?benchmark orkg:evaluation?evaluation.
       FILTER (?evaluation IS NOT NULL)
     }<|eot_id|>
