Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the All-attention network - 18 layers model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
     PREFIX orkg: <http://www.orkgr.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX orkp: <http://www.orkgp.org/ontology/>
     SELECT?paper?code
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkp:HAS_PAPER?p.
    ?p orkp:HAS_CODE?code.
     FILTER (strContains(STR(?paper), "All-attention network - 18 layers model") AND 
     strContains(STR(?code), "benchmarking purposes"))
     }
     ```sparql
```
 
    If you want to query the ORKG, you can use the SPARQL query above. The SPARQL query will return the code references in papers that have used the All-attention network - 18 layers model for benchmarking purposes. 

    Please note that the query is based on the context provided and the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The query may need to be adjusted based on the actual data in the ORKG. 

    If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to ask. 

    The following is an example of how to use the SPARQL query to query the ORKG.
    You can use the following command to execute the SPARQL query:
    ```bash
    curl -X POST \
    http://example.com/sparql \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/sparql-query' \
    -d 'PREFIX orkg: <http://www.orkgr.org/ontology/> 
    PREFIX orkp: <http://www.orkgp.org/ontology/> 
    SELECT?paper?code 
    WHERE { 
   ?paper orkp:HAS_PAPER?p. 
   ?p orkp:HAS_CODE?code. 
    FILTER (strContains(STR(?paper), "All-attention network - 18 layers model") AND 
    strContains(STR(?code), "benchmarking purposes")) 
    }'
    ```
    Please replace 'http://example.com/sparql' with the actual endpoint URL of the ORKG. 

    The response from the ORKG will contain the code references in papers that have used the All-attention network - 18 layers model for benchmarking purposes. 

    Please note that the actual data in the ORKG may be different from the data used to generate the SPARQL query. 
    ```sparql
    ```sparql
    Note: This response was generated based on the provided context and the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The actual data in the ORKG may be different from the data used to generate the SPARQL query.
