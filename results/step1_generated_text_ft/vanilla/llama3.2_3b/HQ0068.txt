Question:
Which sectors are modeled as energy sectors and how often?

    I can help you with the code. It seems like a well-structured SPARQL query that retrieves information about energy sectors and their frequencies from the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). 

    The query uses various prefixes to define the namespaces for the RDF and OWL data, and then selects the sectors and their frequencies. The `FILTER` clause ensures that only sectors labeled as "energy sector" or "energy" are included in the results. The `GROUP BY` and `HAVING` clauses are used to group the results by sector label and filter out sectors with only one occurrence, respectively. Finally, the results are ordered by frequency in descending order and limited to the top 10 sectors. 

    If you'd like me to explain any part of the query or provide further assistance, feel free to ask! 

    Here is the code again for reference:

PREFIX xsd: <http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#>

PREFIX energy: <http://openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/energy#>
SELECT?sector?frequency
WHERE {
 ?sector rdf:type orkg:EnergySector.
 ?sector rdfs:label?sectorLabel.
 ?sector orkg:frequency?frequency.
 ?sector orkg:energySource?energySource.
  FILTER (STRLIKE(?sectorLabel, "energy sector") || STRLIKE(?sectorLabel, "energy"))
  BIND(STR(?sectorLabel) AS?sectorLabel)
  BIND(STR(?sectorLabel) AS?sector)
} GROUP BY?sectorLabel
HAVING COUNT(?sector) > 1
ORDER BY DESC(?frequency) 
LIMIT 10
``` 

    Let me know if you have any further questions or need any modifications to the query! 

    Please note that this is a SPARQL query, and it's designed to be executed on a knowledge graph database that supports SPARQL, such as DBpedia Spotlight or others. The query might not work as-is on other databases or platforms. 

    If you need help with executing the query or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
