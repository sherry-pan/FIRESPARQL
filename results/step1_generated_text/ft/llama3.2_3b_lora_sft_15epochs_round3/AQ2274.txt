Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PEGASUS model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper a orkgc:Paper;
              rdfs:label?title.
       FILTER(REGEX(?title, "PEGASUS"))
      ?paper orkgp:P31?contrib.
      ?contrib orkgp:P32?code.
     }<|eot_id|>
