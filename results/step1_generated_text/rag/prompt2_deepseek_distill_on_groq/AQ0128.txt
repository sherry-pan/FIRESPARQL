Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What are the models that have been benchmarked on the SearchQA dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "models" and "SearchQA dataset." The property implied is "benchmarked on," which relates models to the dataset.

Looking at the context, I see that the RDF data includes information about various resources, predicates, and their values. For example, there are entries about methods like SVM and datasets like MNIST. There's also a detailed description of a research work that involves models and datasets, including mentions of BERT and other NLP models.

I need to compute the similarity between the extracted terms and the entities in the RDF data. Since the question is about models benchmarked on SearchQA, I'll focus on finding models mentioned in the context that are related to datasets.

From the context, I notice mentions of models like SVM and possibly others in the detailed research description. However, the exact models benchmarked on SearchQA aren't explicitly listed, so I'll have to infer based on the information given.

I'll list the top 5 models from the context that are related to datasets, even if not specifically SearchQA, as the context might not have exact matches. This includes SVM, BERT, GPT, CRF, and SciBERT, as these are mentioned in the steps and the research paper description.

Each of these models will have a similarity score based on how closely they relate to the dataset context. Since the context doesn't specify SearchQA, the scores will be moderate, reflecting their general relevance to benchmarking on datasets.

Finally, I'll structure the answer in the required JSON format, grouping the results under the extracted terms and listing the candidates with their URIs, labels, scores, types, and RDF types.
