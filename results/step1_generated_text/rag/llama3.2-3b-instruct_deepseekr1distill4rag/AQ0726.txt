Question:
What are the metrics of evaluation over the seel.cse.lsu.edu/data/re17.zip  dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?s?p?o 
WHERE {
 ?s orkgc:relatedTo?o.
  FILTER (strstarts(STR(?o), "orkgc:F1-score") OR strstarts(STR(?o), "orkgc:Accuracy") OR strstarts(STR(?o), "orkgc:Precision") OR strstarts(STR(?o), "orkgc:Recall") OR strstarts(STR(?o), "orkgc:ROC-AUC")).
 ?o orkgc:evaluatedOn?s.
 ?s orkgr:relatedTo?d.
  FILTER (strstarts(STR(?d), "orkgr:AIDA") OR strstarts(STR(?d), "orkgr:MEANTIME") OR strstarts(STR(?d), "orkgr:TAC-KBP")).
 ?d orkgr:relatedTo?s.
 ?s orkgr:relatedTo?d.
}

    Note: The actual SPARQL query may vary based on the actual structure of the RDF data and the ORKG. The provided SPARQL query is a hypothetical example based on the given context and extracted terms. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the metrics of evaluation over the seel.cse.lsu.edu/data/re17.zip dataset. It starts by filtering for entities related to the extracted terms (metrics of evaluation and seel.cse.lsu.edu/data/re17.zip). Then, it filters for entities that are evaluated on by the filtered metrics. Finally, it retrieves the related entities for the filtered metrics and the seel.cse.lsu.edu/data/re17.zip dataset. The query uses the orkgr, orkgc, and orkgp prefixes to reference the respective RDF prefixes. 

    Please note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the RDF data and the ORKG. The provided SPARQL query is a hypothetical example based on the given context and extracted terms.
