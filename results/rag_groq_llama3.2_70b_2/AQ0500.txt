To address the given question, we'll follow the steps outlined: extracting entities and properties from the question, retrieving similar entities or properties from the RDF data dump based on cosine similarity, and returning the top similar entities or properties. 

Given the question: "Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset?"

1. **Extract Entities and Properties from the Question:**
   - Entities: Research papers, Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset
   - Properties: Titles, IDs, benchmarked models

2. **Retrieve Similar Entities or Properties from the RDF Data Dump:**
   - We need to find entities or properties related to research papers, specifically those that have been benchmarked on the Penn Treebank dataset. However, the provided RDF data does not explicitly mention "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset" or directly relate papers to this dataset through benchmarking. Therefore, we'll look for papers and entities that could be related to the topic, focusing on those labeled as "Paper" or related to natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

3. **Calculate Cosine Similarity:**
   - Since the actual calculation of cosine similarity requires vector representations of the question and the entities/properties, and given the nature of the provided data, we'll simplify this step by looking for entities that match the keywords from the question, such as "Paper", "Research", and "Named Entity" which could be related to NLP tasks.

4. **Return Top Similar Entities or Properties:**
   - Based on the provided data and the simplification for this task, we identify entities that could be related to research papers or NLP tasks. The top similar entities or properties, given the constraints, would include those labeled as "Paper" and potentially related to NLP or entity recognition tasks.

Given these steps and the simplifications due to the nature of the provided data, a potential output could include entities such as:

```json
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524",
    "label": "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire",
    "score": 0.8
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211922",
    "label": "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)",
    "score": 0.7
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211327",
    "label": "No specific label provided in the data",
    "score": 0.6
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R44252",
    "label": "BioBERT achieved the highest F1 scores",
    "score": 0.5
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R44243",
    "label": "captures the meaning of the correlation between words based on multi-head attention",
    "score": 0.4
  }
]
```

Note: The scores are hypothetical and based on a simplified approach to match entities with the question's context, as the actual calculation of cosine similarity would require more detailed vector representations of both the question and the entities/properties. The provided RDF data does not directly answer the question about the Penn Treebank dataset, so the response focuses on related entities that could be of interest.
