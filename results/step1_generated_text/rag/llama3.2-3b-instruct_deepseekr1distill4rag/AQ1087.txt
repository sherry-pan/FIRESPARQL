Question:
What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset ACE 2004?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?metric?value
WHERE {
 ?resource orkgc:hasBenchmarkResult?benchmarkResult.
 ?benchmarkResult orkgr:hasMetric?metric.
 ?benchmarkResult orkgr:hasValue?value.
 ?benchmarkResult orkgr:hasDataset?dataset.
  FILTER (?dataset = <http://example.org/orkgr/ACE_2004>).
 ?resource orkgp:P97004?metric.
 ?benchmarkResult orkgr:hasResource?resource.
}
``` 
    Note that the dataset "ACE 2004" is not explicitly mentioned in the RDF data, so the query filters for a dataset with the exact URI "http://example.org/orkgr/ACE_2004". You may need to adjust this query based on the actual structure of your RDF data. 

    Please note that the SPARQL query is a direct translation of the JSON output, with some minor adjustments to fit the query syntax. The query is designed to retrieve the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset "ACE 2004", using the extracted terms and candidates from the JSON output. 

    The query uses the following prefixes: orkgc, orkgr, and orkgp to denote the respective namespaces. The query then selects the metric and value properties from the benchmark result resources that have the specified dataset and metric. The filter clause ensures that only resources with the exact dataset URI are considered. 

    You may need to adjust this query based on the actual structure of your RDF data, as the dataset "ACE 2004" is not explicitly mentioned in the RDF data. 

    The query assumes that the RDF data is stored in a graph with the specified prefixes. The actual query syntax may vary depending on the specific RDF store being used.
