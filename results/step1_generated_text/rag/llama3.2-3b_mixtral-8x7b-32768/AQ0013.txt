Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the CommonsenseQA dataset?

Generated SPARQL:

    The SPARQL query is designed to find models that have been evaluated on the CommonsenseQA dataset. It starts by selecting models that have a model model (a model that is a model of something), and then selects the dataset that the model is associated with. Then it selects the evaluation that the dataset is associated with, and filters to only include evaluations that contain the string "CommonsenseQA". The selected model and dataset are then returned. 

    The query is designed to work with the ORKG, but may need adjustments to match the actual structure of the knowledge graph. 

    The query is based on the provided context, which includes the extracted terms, candidates, and background information for linking the correct entities or properties in the ORKG. 

    The query is designed to retrieve the correct answer to the input question, "Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the CommonsenseQA dataset?" 

    The query is based on the assumption that the models, datasets, and evaluations are represented as resources in the ORKG, and that the relationships between them are represented using predicates. 

    The query is designed to use the provided predicates and resources in the ORKG to retrieve the correct answer.
