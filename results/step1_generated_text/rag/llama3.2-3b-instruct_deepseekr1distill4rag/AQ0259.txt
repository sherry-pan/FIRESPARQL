Question:
What models are being evaluated on the Atari 2600 Solaris dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc#>
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr#>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp#>

    SELECT?model?dataset
    WHERE {
     ?model orkp:P28 orkp:P27 orkp:P29?dataset.
      FILTER (bif:contains(str(?dataset), "Atari 2600 Solaris")).
    }
    ``` 

    Note: The SPARQL query uses the prefixes `orkgc`, `orkgr`, and `orkp` as specified in the context. The `bif:contains` function is used to filter the results to only include datasets containing the string "Atari 2600 Solaris". The `str` function is used to convert the dataset URI to a string, and `bif:contains` is used to check if the string contains the specified substring. 

    The `SELECT` clause specifies the variables to be selected, which are `?model` and `?dataset`. The `WHERE` clause specifies the conditions under which the query will return results. In this case, the query filters the results to only include datasets that contain the string "Atari 2600 Solaris". 

    The `FILTER` clause is used to apply the filter condition to the results. In this case, the filter condition is `bif:contains(str(?dataset), "Atari 2600 Solaris")`, which checks if the dataset URI contains the string "Atari 2600 Solaris". 

    The `orkp:P28`, `orkp:P27`, and `orkp:P29` predicates are used to link the models to the datasets. The `?model` variable is used to represent the model, and the `?dataset` variable is used to represent the dataset. 

    The `SELECT` clause is followed by the `WHERE` clause, which specifies the conditions under which the query will return results. The `FILTER` clause is used to apply the filter condition to the results. 

    The `FILTER` clause is used to apply the filter condition to the results. In this case, the filter condition is `bif:contains(str(?dataset), "Atari 2600 Solaris")`, which checks if the dataset URI contains the string "Atari 2600 Solaris".
