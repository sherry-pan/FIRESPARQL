Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Amazon-2 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric?metric_lbl
     WHERE {
       orkgp:R1 orkgp:P2?eval;
       orkgp:R1 orkgp:P3?model.
      ?eval orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric;
      ?metric rdfs:label?metric_lbl.
       FILTER(REGEX(STR(?metric_lbl), "Amazon-2"))
     }   

    Explanation:
    The question asks for evaluation metrics used in benchmarking models on the Amazon-2 dataset.
    In the context provided, the candidates for the Amazon-2 dataset are orkgp:R122690, orkgp:HAS_METRIC, and orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION.
    We use the filter condition to match only metrics that have "Amazon-2" in the labels.
    The SPARQL query selects all the metrics and their corresponding labels. 
    The SELECT statement uses the aliases of the properties to make the query more readable.
    The WHERE clause consists of four parts: 
    1. Selecting the relevant triple pattern.
    2. Filtering the results to include only the Amazon-2 dataset.
    3. Using the filter condition to select metrics with "Amazon-2" in their labels.
    4. Selecting the metric labels. 
    The use of regex in the filter function allows us to match the labels in a case-sensitive manner. 
    We could have also used the filter condition to match the labels in a case-insensitive manner by using the i flag, i.e., FILTER(REGEX(STR(?metric_lbl), "Amazon-2", "i")).

    The final answer to the question is: The SPARQL query is provided above.
    Note that the final answer is not a number but a query that can be executed to get the correct answer. 

    ```python
def get_evaluation_metrics_on_amazon2_dataset():
    orkgp = orkgp  # assuming orkgp is the correct namespace
    query = """
    SELECT?metric?metric_lbl
    WHERE {
       orkgp:R1 orkgp:P2?eval;
       orkgp:R1 orkgp:P3?model.
      ?eval orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric;
      ?metric rdfs:label?metric_lbl.
       FILTER(REGEX(STR(?metric_lbl), "Amazon-2"))
     }
    """
    return query

# execute the function to get the final answer
final_answer = get_evaluation_metrics_on_amazon2_dataset()
print("The final answer is", final_answer)
``` 
    The final answer is: SELECT?metric?metric_lbl
     WHERE {
       orkgp:R1 orkgp:P2?eval;
       orkgp:R1 orkgp:P3?model.
      ?eval orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric
