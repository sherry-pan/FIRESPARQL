Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What quantity of iron oxide was discovered on Elorza crater?" using the provided ORKG RDF data. Let me start by understanding the context and the data given.

First, I look at the context information. It's a series of RDF triples in Turtle format. I see that there are several resources, like R147652, R147244, R147246, and others. Each resource has various predicates and objects. For example, R147652 has a predicate P39020 with several steps described as strings. These steps talk about methods, datasets, and some algorithms like SVM and MNIST, which I recognize as related to machine learning.

Then there's R147244, which has a HAS_VALUE predicate with the string "93.9". I'm not sure what this value represents yet. R147246 has multiple P27 predicates with names like "Ligia Sierra", "Betty L LÃ³pez", etc., which seem to be authors. It also has P29 as "2015" and P28 as "6". Maybe this is a publication or a paper with 6 authors from 2015.

Looking further, there's a resource R283709 with predicates like P5044 as "Journal Article", P41920 as "scholarly domain", and others. It also has P3000 with a list of keywords like "Graph analytics", "Horizon 2020", "Keyphrase extraction", etc. This seems like a paper's metadata.

R283710 has similar structures with authors and a publication year of 2021. The P3000 here includes "Knowledge graph; Named entity recognition", which relates to the methods described in R147652.

Now, the question is about the quantity of iron oxide discovered on Elorza crater. I need to find if any of the RDF triples mention iron oxide or Elorza crater. Scanning through the data, I don't see any mention of "iron oxide" or "Elorza crater". The data seems to focus more on methods, datasets, and publications rather than specific geological discoveries.

The only numerical value I see is "93.9" in R147244, but without context, I can't link it to iron oxide or Elorza crater. The other numbers like "2015" and "6" are related to publication years and author counts, not quantities of substances.

Since the provided data doesn't contain any information about Elorza crater or iron oxide, I can't extract any relevant terms or candidates. Therefore, the answer would be that there's no data available in the provided context to answer the question.

The provided context does not contain any information related to the quantity of iron oxide discovered on Elorza crater. Therefore, there are no relevant terms or candidates to extract for this query.
