Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the ObjectNet dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://www.orkg.org/>

     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper a orkg:ResearchPaper.
    ?paper rdfs:label?title.
    ?paper orkg:hasID?id.
    ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset?dataset.
    ?dataset rdfs:label "ObjectNet".
     FILTER (?benchmark orkg:hasBenchmarksOnDataset?dataset).
     }<|eot_id|>
