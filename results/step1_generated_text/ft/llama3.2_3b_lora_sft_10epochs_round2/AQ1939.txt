Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Concept Mention Extraction model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
        ?paper    a            orkgc:Paper;
                  rdfs:label   ?paper_lbl.
         FILTER(REGEX(?paper_lbl, "Concept Mention Extraction"))
        ?paper orkgp:P31?cont.
        ?cont orkgp:P32?eval.
        ?eval orkgp:P3309?benchmark.
        ?benchmark orkgp:P3373?code.
     }<|eot_id|>
