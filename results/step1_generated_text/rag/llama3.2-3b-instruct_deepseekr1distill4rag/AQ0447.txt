Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the CUB-200-2011 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT?title?id 
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:includesBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:relatedTo?benchmarkDataset.
 ?benchmarkDataset ora:relatedTo?dataset.
 ?dataset rdfs:label?datasetLabel.
 ?dataset rdfs:label?datasetLabel.
 ?dataset rdfs:label "CUB-200-2011_dataset"@en.
 ?paper ora:identifier?id.
 ?paper ora:title?title.
}
```

    Note that the SPARQL query is case-sensitive. The `@en` label for the dataset is used to specify the language of the label. The `ora:` prefix is used for the properties defined in the ORKG ontology, and `rdfs:` is used for the RDF schema properties. The `a` predicate is used to assert the type of a resource, and `ora:includesBenchmark` is used to assert that a paper includes a benchmark. The `ora:identifier` and `ora:title` properties are used to retrieve the IDs and titles of papers, respectively. The `?datasetLabel` variable is bound to the label of the dataset. The `?benchmarkDataset` variable is bound to the dataset related to the benchmark. The `?benchmark` variable is bound to the benchmark related to the paper. The `?id` and `?title` variables are bound to the ID and title of the paper, respectively. The `?paper` variable is bound to the research paper. The `?benchmark` variable is bound to the benchmark.
