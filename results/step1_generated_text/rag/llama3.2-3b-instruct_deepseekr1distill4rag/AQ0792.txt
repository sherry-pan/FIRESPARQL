Question:
List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Quasart-T benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/predicates/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/resources/>

SELECT?metric 
WHERE {
 ?metric orkgp:evaluates?model. 
 ?model orkgc:partOf <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/resources/Quasart-Tbenchmark>.
 ?metric rdfs:label?metricLabel.
}
``` 
    Note: The above SPARQL query is a hypothetical one, and it is not guaranteed to be correct. It is only an example of how the query might look like. The actual query might need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data and the specific requirements of the ORKG. 

    The query is based on the following assumptions:

    1. The "metrics" extracted from the question are the ones that are used to evaluate models on the Quasart-T benchmark dataset.
    2. The "evaluate models on" property is used to link the metrics to the models.
    3. The Quasart-T benchmark dataset is a resource that is part of the ORKG, and it has a unique URI.
    4. The metrics used to evaluate models on the Quasart-T benchmark dataset are described in the RDF data using the rdfs:label property.

    Please note that these assumptions might not be correct, and the actual query might need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data and the specific requirements of the ORKG. 

    Also, please note that the query is just an example, and it might not be the correct query to get the desired results. It's always a good idea to test the query on a small subset of the data before running it on the entire dataset.
