Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg#>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp#>
    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

    SELECT?metric?model 
    WHERE {
   ?metric orkgp:hasMetric orkg:R122689.
   ?metric orkgp:hasMetric orkggp:HAS_METRIC.
   ?model orkgp:hasModel orkg:R122689.
   ?model orkgp:hasModel orkggp:HAS_MODEL.
    FILTER (str(?metric) = "accuracy" OR str(?metric) = "f1-score" OR str(?metric) = "mean-precision" OR str(?metric) = "mean-recall")
    FILTER (str(?model) = "deep-rl" OR str(?model) = "model-rl")
}
``` 
    Note: The actual SPARQL query might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the data in the ORKG. The provided SPARQL query is just an example based on the provided context. 

    The provided SPARQL query is an example query that retrieves the evaluation metrics and benchmarking models that are commonly used for the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std dataset. The query filters the results based on the common evaluation metrics and benchmarking models mentioned in the question. 

    Note that the actual SPARQL query might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the data in the ORKG. 

    Also, please note that the provided SPARQL query uses the `str` function to filter the results based on the string values of the evaluation metrics and benchmarking models. This is just an example and the actual SPARQL query might need to be adjusted based on the actual data in the ORKG. 

    Please let me know if you need any further assistance. 

    The final answer is the SPARQL query itself. 
    ```sparql
    SELECT?metric?model 
    WHERE {
   ?metric orkgp:hasMetric orkg:R
