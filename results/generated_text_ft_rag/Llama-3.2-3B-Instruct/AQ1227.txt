Question:
What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the Cartpole, swingup (DMControl500k) dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?metric?metric_lbl (COUNT(?eval) AS?eval_cnt)
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Cartpole, swingup (DMControl500k)")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?eval          orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                 rdfs:label              ?eval_lbl.
  OPTIONAL {?eval      orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.
          ?metric      rdfs:label              ?metric_lbl.}
}
GROUP BY?metric?metric_lbl
ORDER BY DESC(?eval_cnt)
LIMIT 1;
```    Note: The output SPARQL query is slightly modified to only retrieve the top 1 result, as per the original question. The original query would have returned all results, but the question specifically asks for the "highest benchmark result". 

    If you want to generate a query that returns all results, you can simply remove the `LIMIT 1` clause. 

    If you want to generate a query that returns the top N results, you can replace the `LIMIT 1` clause with `LIMIT?n`, where `?n` is the number of results you want to return. 

    You can also modify the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results in a different way, for example `ORDER BY DESC(?eval_cnt) DESC?metric?metric_lbl`. 

    Keep in mind that the `SELECT` clause of the SPARQL query should always be `SELECT?metric?metric_lbl (COUNT(?eval) AS?eval_cnt)`, and the `WHERE` clause should always be `WHERE {...}`. The `ORDER BY` clause should be used to sort the results, and the `LIMIT` clause should be used to limit the number of results returned. 

    You can also add additional clauses to the `WHERE` clause to filter the results further, for example `FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Cartpole, swingup (DMControl500k)")`. 

    You can also use the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by different properties, for example `GROUP BY?dataset?dataset_lbl`. 

    You can also use the `OPTIONAL` clause to make the query more flexible, for example `OPTIONAL {?eval      orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.}`. 

    You can also use the `UNION` clause to combine the results of multiple queries, for example `UNION {... } UNION {... }`. 

    You can also use the `EXISTS` clause to check if a certain condition is true, for example `EXISTS {?cont orkgp:P31?eval.}`. 

    You can also use the `FILTER` clause to filter the results based on a certain condition, for example `FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Cartpole, swingup (DMControl500k)")`. 

    You can also use the `BOUND` clause to bind a variable to a certain value, for example `BOUND(?eval_lbl) BY?eval_lbl.`

    You can also use the `CONCAT` clause to concatenate two or more strings, for example `CONCAT(str(?dataset_lbl), " ", str(?eval_lbl)).`

    You can also use the `REPLACE` clause to replace a certain substring with another substring, for example `REPLACE(str(?dataset_lbl), " ", "_")`.

    You can also use the `STARTS` clause to check if a certain string starts with another string, for example `STARTS(?dataset_lbl, "Cartpole, swingup (DMControl500k)")`. 

    You can also use the `ENDS` clause to check if a certain string ends with another string, for example `ENDS(?dataset_lbl, "DMControl500k")`. 

    You can also use the `CONTAINS` clause to check if a certain string contains another string, for example `CONTAINS(?dataset_lbl, "Cartpole")`. 

    You can also use the `STRLEN` clause to get the length of a string, for example `STRLEN(str(?dataset_lbl))`.

    You can also use the `SUBSTR` clause to get a substring of a string, for example `SUBSTR(str(?dataset_lbl), 0, 10)`. 

    You can also use the `REGEX` clause to search for a pattern in a string, for example `REGEX(str(?dataset_lbl), "Cartpole, swingup (DMControl500k)")`. 

    You can also use the `IRI` clause to check if a certain string is an IRI, for example `IRI(?dataset_lbl)`. 

    You can also use the `BAG` clause to create
