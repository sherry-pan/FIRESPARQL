Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PEGASUS model for benchmarking purposes?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "PEGASUS model" and "benchmarking purposes." The properties involved are "code references" and "papers."

Next, I'll look through the RDF data to find entities and properties that are similar to these terms. I'll calculate cosine similarity based on their textual representations.

Looking at the context, I see mentions of models like SVM and datasets like MNIST, but nothing directly about PEGASUS. However, there are research papers and techniques related to NER and entity linking, which might be relevant.

I'll retrieve the top 10 similar entities for each term. For "PEGASUS model," I might find related models or techniques. For "benchmarking purposes," I'll look for properties related to evaluation or assessment.

After computing the similarity scores, I'll select the top 5 candidates for each extracted term. Since the data doesn't explicitly mention PEGASUS, the results might be broader but still relevant.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their top candidates, ensuring the correct RDF prefixes and types are used.
