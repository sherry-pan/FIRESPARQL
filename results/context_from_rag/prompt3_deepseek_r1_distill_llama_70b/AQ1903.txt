Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the datasets benchmarked under the Fine-Grained Image Classification research problem?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "Fine-Grained Image Classification" as the research problem and "datasets" that are benchmarked under it. The property involved is "benchmarked under," which likely relates datasets to their corresponding research problems.

Next, I need to find similar entities or properties in the RDF data. Looking through the context, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there's a resource R147652 which has multiple steps described, but I'm not sure if that's related. Then there are resources like R147244, R147246, and R283709, which seem to be about projects, publications, and methods.

I notice that R283709 is a journal article with keywords like "Graph analytics," "Horizon 2020," "Keyphrase extraction," etc. It also mentions "Named entity recognition" and "Text mining." This might be related to methods rather than datasets. 

Looking for datasets, I see mentions of "MNIST" in the steps under R147652. MNIST is a well-known dataset, so that could be a candidate. There's also "SVM" mentioned, which is a model, not a dataset. 

I don't see any direct mention of "Fine-Grained Image Classification," but perhaps "MNIST" is a dataset used in image classification tasks. Another possible dataset could be "CIFAR," but it's not explicitly mentioned here. 

Since the context doesn't provide specific datasets for Fine-Grained Image Classification, I'll have to infer based on the available data. The steps mention expanding seed terms like "SVM" and "MNIST," so MNIST is a likely candidate. 

I also need to consider the properties. The question is about datasets benchmarked under a research problem, so the property might be something like "hasBenchmark" or "benchmarkedOn." In the context, I see predicates like P39020, which describes steps, and P27, which lists authors. There's also P5044 indicating "Journal Article" and P41924 for "scholarly domain." 

I don't see a direct predicate for benchmarking, but perhaps P97003 is "entity extraction," which might relate to how datasets are used in benchmarks. 

Putting this together, the extracted terms are "Fine-Grained Image Classification," "datasets," and "benchmarked under." The top candidates for datasets would include MNIST, as it's the only dataset mentioned in the context related to image classification. 

I'll structure the JSON output accordingly, grouping the results under each extracted term. Since the context is limited, the candidates might be fewer than expected, but I'll include what's available.
