Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Atari 2600 Venture dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?paper?paperTitle?paperId
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgp:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgp:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgr:hasName "Atari 2600 Venture dataset"@en.
 ?paper orkgp:hasTitle?paperTitle.
 ?paper orkgp:hasId?paperId.
}
``` 
    Note: The `@en` in the SPARQL query is used to specify the language of the literal value in the dataset name. The RDF prefixes `orkgr:` and `orkgp:` are used to refer to the ORKG and its predicates, respectively. The `SELECT` clause specifies the variables to retrieve, and the `WHERE` clause defines the query pattern. The `?paper` variable represents a research paper, and the `?benchmark` variable represents a benchmark. The `?dataset` variable represents a dataset, and the `?paperTitle` and `?paperId` variables represent the title and ID of a research paper, respectively. The `@en` keyword is used to specify the language of the literal value in the dataset name. The `orkgr:hasName` and `orkgp:hasDataset` predicates are used to link the dataset to the research paper and benchmark, respectively.
