Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Atari 2600 Bowling dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric
    ?metric rdfs:label?metric_label
     FILTER (str(?metric_label) = "accuracy")
     UNION
     FILTER (str(?metric_label) = "F1-score")
     UNION
     FILTER (str(?metric_label) = "Precision")
     UNION
     FILTER (str(?metric_label) = "Recall")
