Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the WMT2016 German-English dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset        a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WMT2016 German-English")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
      ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                      rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
      }<|eot_id|>
