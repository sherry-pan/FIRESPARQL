Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the CUB-200-2011 dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "research papers" and "CUB-200-2011 dataset". The properties involved are "include a benchmark for".

Looking at the context, I see two main resources: R147246 and R284317. Both are papers with details like authors, venues, and years.

I need to find which of these papers mention the CUB-200-2011 dataset. However, scanning through the context, I don't see any direct mention of "CUB-200-2011". But I can look for papers that are related to datasets or benchmarks.

R147246 is from 2015 and involves authors like Ligia Sierra and others. R284317 is from 2021 and includes authors Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta. The abstract of R284316 talks about extracting entity knowledge and using datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP, but not CUB-200-2011.

Since there's no direct mention, I might have to consider that the context doesn't provide the necessary information. Therefore, the candidates list would be empty because there's no matching data.

I should structure the JSON response with the extracted terms and an empty candidates list for each term.
