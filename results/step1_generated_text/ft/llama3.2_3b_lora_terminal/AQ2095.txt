Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the Fine-Grained Gating model?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?model       a            orkgc:Model;
                   rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "Fine-Grained Gating")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                       orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
      ?code          rdfs:label               ?code_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?code_lbl) = "code")
     }

    You can also use `str(?cont_lbl) = "cont"` to filter by the label of the container (if it is different from the code). If you want to filter by the model's label, you can use `str(?model_lbl) = "model"`.  
    The `str(?cont_lbl) = "cont"` can be used to filter by the label of the container (if it is different from the code). If you want to filter by the model's label, you can use `str(?model_lbl) = "model"`.
