Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the BoolQ dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkg: <http://orkgr.org/ontology/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://orkgc.org/ontology/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkgp.org/ontology/>
    SELECT?model?dataset
    WHERE {
     ?model orkgp:has_model?m.
     ?m orkgp:has_benchmark?b.
     ?b orkgp:has_evaluation?e.
     ?e orkgp:has_dataset?dataset.
     ?dataset orkgc:dataset?dataset.
      FILTER (regex(str(?dataset), "BoolQ"))
    }
    ```



    The final answer is not a simple number that can be boxed. The final answer is the provided SPARQL query. 

Note: The provided SPARQL query is generated based on the given context and the requirements. It may not be the only possible SPARQL query to answer the question, but it is one possible solution.<|eot_id|>
