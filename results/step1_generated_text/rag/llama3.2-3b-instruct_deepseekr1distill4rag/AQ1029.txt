Question:
Can you list the metrics used to evaluate models on the DocRED (Human-annotated) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?m
WHERE {
 ?m rdfs:label?l.
  filter (str(?l) = "accuracy" OR str(?l) = "precision" OR str(?l) = "F1-score" )
 ?m rdfs:label?m.
 ?m rdfs:label?m.
 ?m a ora:Metric.
 ?m ora:usedOn?e.
 ?e ora:dataset?d.
 ?d ora:datasetName "DocRED (Human-annotated)".
}
``` 
    Please note that the output SPARQL query is based on the provided context and the question. It might not be the most efficient or accurate query, but it's an attempt to follow the instructions as closely as possible. The query is also based on the assumption that the provided context and question are the only information available to answer the question.
