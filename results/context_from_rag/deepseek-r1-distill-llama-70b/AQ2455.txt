Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question about finding papers that used the XLNet (base) model and include links to their code. 

First, the question is asking for papers, so I should look for properties related to academic works or publications. The JSON has properties like "has benchmark", "evaluation", "method", etc. 

"Has implementation" seems relevant because it might link to where the model is implemented, possibly including code. "Method" is also important because it describes the approach used in the paper, which could mention XLNet. 

"Has dataset" might be useful if the papers used specific datasets with XLNet. "Evaluation" could provide results that might indicate the use of XLNet. 

"Implementation" directly relates to code, so that's a key property. "Approach" is another term for method, so it's also relevant. 

I should list these properties with their IRIs and explain why each is useful for finding the required information.
