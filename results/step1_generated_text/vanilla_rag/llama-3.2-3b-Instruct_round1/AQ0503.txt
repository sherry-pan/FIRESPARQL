Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the BIOSSES dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/>
     SELECT?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
    ?dataset orkg:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:HAS_EVALUATION?evaluation.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Titles?title.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Name?id.
     FILTER (STRLIKE(?dataset, 'BIOSSES') OR STRLIKE(?id, 'BIOSSES'))
     }<|eot_id|>
