Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking for a list of papers that have used the SAC model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information to find any mentions of SAC or related terms. The context has two main sections. The first part describes a research process with steps, and the second part talks about a paper titled "validation research" with authors like Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta, published in 2021. 

I don't see any direct mention of the SAC model in the context. The first part discusses methods like SVM and MNIST, and the second part focuses on NLP tasks and models like Stanford NER and Flair NER. There's no reference to SAC or any code links. 

Since the context doesn't provide the necessary information, I can't retrieve any relevant papers or code links related to SAC. Therefore, the answer should indicate that no relevant information was found in the provided data.

Based on the provided context, there is no information about the SAC model or papers that have utilized it. The context discusses other topics such as NER approaches, entity recognition, and specific research papers, but it does not mention SAC or related code links.
