Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the A3C LSTM hs model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://orkgr.org/resource/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://orkgp.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkn: <http://orknp.org/resource/>

SELECT?paper?paper_uri?model_uri?code_uri
WHERE {
 ?paper orkp:HAS_PAPER?model.
 ?model orkp:HAS_MODEL?model_uri.
 ?model orkp:HAS_CODE?code_uri.
 ?paper orkg:has_contribution?contribution.
 ?contribution orkg:has_resource?resource.
 ?resource orkg:has_label?label.
  FILTER (str(?label) = "A3C LSTM hs model").
 ?paper orkp:has_label?paper_label.
  FILTER (str(?paper_label) = "paper").

```sparql

Note that the SPARQL query is not correct and will not return the expected results. It's a template with placeholders for the actual values, which you need to fill in. You can't just copy and paste the query from the template. You need to analyze the context, the entities and properties mentioned in the question, and the candidates in the context to create a correct SPARQL query. The query should filter the papers that have utilized the A3C LSTM hs model and include the links to their code. 

The final answer should be a valid SPARQL query that can be executed on the ORKG to retrieve the correct results. 

Please provide a correct SPARQL query based on the context provided. 

Note: The actual output will depend on the analysis of the context, the entities and properties mentioned in the question, and the candidates in the context. 

Also, the actual output will depend on the structure of the ORKG, which is not provided here. 

Based on the context provided, the correct SPARQL query could be:
```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://orkgr.org/resource/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://orkgp.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkn: <http://orknp.org/resource/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
