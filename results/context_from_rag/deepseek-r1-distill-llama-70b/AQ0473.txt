Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to answering the question about research papers that performed benchmarks on the Rotowire (Content Selection) dataset. 

First, the question is asking for a list of papers, so I should look for properties related to papers or publications. The JSON has a property labeled "has benchmark" which seems directly related because benchmarks are often used in research papers to evaluate methods or datasets.

Next, the question mentions the Rotowire dataset specifically, so I need a way to identify papers associated with this dataset. The property "has dataset" would be useful here as it likely links papers to the datasets they use.

Since the user wants both titles and IDs of the papers, I should look for properties that capture these details. The "titles" property would provide the names of the papers, and "evaluation" could include performance metrics, which are often part of benchmarking.

Additionally, the "method" property might be relevant because papers usually describe the methods they use, which could be applied to the Rotowire dataset. This could help in identifying which papers are using specific techniques on this dataset.

Putting it all together, the properties "has benchmark", "has dataset", "titles", "evaluation", and "method" seem to cover the necessary aspects: identifying benchmarking papers, linking them to the Rotowire dataset, and providing the required details about each paper.
