Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Macro Precision metric on the NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only) benchmark dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities and properties mentioned are "model," "Macro Precision metric," and "NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only) benchmark dataset." 

Next, I'll look through the context information to find related entities and properties. From the context, I see that there are resources like R147652 which describes a method involving steps using SVM and MNIST as seed terms. There's also R284316 which talks about a journal article on extracting entity knowledge using NLP techniques. 

I need to compute the similarity between the extracted terms and the entities in the RDF data. Since the question is about models and their performance on a specific dataset, I'll focus on resources that are models and have metrics associated with them. 

Looking at the context, R147652 mentions using a CRF algorithm, which is a type of model. R284316 discusses various NLP tools like Stanford NER and Flair NER, which are models. 

I'll calculate the cosine similarity between the terms. "Model" would match with resources like R147652 and R284316. "Macro Precision" might relate to the performance metrics mentioned, such as the 93.9 value in R147244. The dataset "NLP-TDMS" isn't directly mentioned, but R284316 is about NLP tasks, so there's some relevance.

Based on this, I'll select the top candidates. R147652 and R284316 are the most relevant models. The Macro Precision metric would correspond to the high value in R147244. The dataset, while not explicitly named, is closest to R284316's context.

So, the final answer should list these top candidates with their respective scores.
