Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to answering the question: "List the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the WMT2014 German-English dataset?" 

First, I'll break down the question. It's asking for research papers that have benchmarks on a specific dataset, WMT2014 German-English. So, I need properties related to benchmarks, datasets, and possibly the papers themselves.

Looking at the JSON properties, I see several that might be useful. 

1. "has benchmark" (property: HAS_BENCHMARK) seems directly relevant because the question is about benchmarks.
2. "has dataset" (property: HAS_DATASET) is important because the benchmark is over a specific dataset.
3. "evaluation" (property: HAS_EVALUATION) could be useful since benchmarks are often part of evaluations.
4. "method" (property: HAS_METHOD) might help identify the methods used in the benchmark.
5. "title" (property: CSVW_Titles) is necessary to get the titles of the papers.
6. "implementation" (property: HAS_IMPLEMENTATION) could relate to how the benchmark was set up.

I should list these properties with their IRIs and explain why each is relevant. I'll make sure not to reference the context directly, just explain each choice based on the question's requirements.
