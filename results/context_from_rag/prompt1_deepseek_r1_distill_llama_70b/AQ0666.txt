Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given ORKG RDF data. The query is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the ObjectNet dataset, along with their titles and IDs. 

First, I should look through the provided context to find any mentions of research papers. From the context, I see several resources labeled as "Paper". For example, R211524 is a paper titled "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire". Similarly, R211922 is another paper titled "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)". There's also R211327, which is a paper but without a provided title in the context. 

Next, I need to check if any of these papers mention the ObjectNet dataset. However, looking through the context, I don't see any direct references to ObjectNet. The papers mentioned are about named entity recognition and neural modeling, which don't seem related to ObjectNet. 

Since the context doesn't provide information about ObjectNet, I can't find any relevant papers from the given data. Therefore, the result is an empty list because there are no matching papers in the provided RDF dump.

The query requests research papers that have performed benchmarks on the ObjectNet dataset. Upon examining the provided context, the available papers do not mention ObjectNet. Therefore, no relevant papers are found.
