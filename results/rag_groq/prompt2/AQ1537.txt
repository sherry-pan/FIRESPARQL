Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What is the name of the top performing model in terms of Number of params score when benchmarked on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "model" and "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset". The property mentioned is "Number of params score".

Looking at the context, I see that there are two main resources, R147652 and R284316, each with several predicates. R147652 describes a method with five steps, and R284316 talks about a journal article on entity knowledge extraction.

I need to find entities related to models and datasets. From the context, I see mentions of "SVM" and "MNIST" as seed terms, but the question is about the Penn Treebank dataset. Since the provided data doesn't explicitly mention Penn Treebank, I'll have to infer based on the structure.

The models mentioned in the context include "SVM" and other NER models like "Stanford NER" and "Flair NER". However, the question is about the top-performing model in terms of the number of parameters, which isn't directly addressed in the context. 

I'll have to consider that the context might not have the specific information needed, so the answer might not be present. Alternatively, I can look for any models mentioned and their performance metrics. 

In the context, R147652's steps mention using a CRF algorithm, which is a type of model. R284316 discusses various models like Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL. 

Since the question is about the Penn Treebank dataset and number of parameters, and the context doesn't provide specific data on this, I might have to conclude that there's no relevant candidate. However, I can still structure the answer based on the available models and datasets, even if they're not exact matches.

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and list the models mentioned in the context as candidates, even if they don't directly relate to the Penn Treebank dataset. This way, the answer follows the required format but notes that the specific dataset isn't found.
