Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user is asking for a list of papers that have used the Table-Sequence method and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of the Table-Sequence method. Scanning through the triples, I see that there's a resource R147246 which has a predicate P27 with the value "Ligia Sierra", and another with "Betty L LÃ³pez", etc. But I don't see any direct mention of "Table-Sequence" here. 

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The context includes information about papers, their venues, and authors, but nothing explicitly about the Table-Sequence method. There's also a section about a method involving steps like seed terms, term expansion, NER, etc., but again, no mention of Table-Sequence.

Since the context doesn't have any information related to the Table-Sequence method or papers that use it, I can't extract any relevant terms or find similar entities. Therefore, the extracted terms would be empty, and there are no candidates to list.

I should inform the user that based on the provided context, there's no information available to answer their query. Maybe they can provide more context or check a different dataset.

Based on the provided context, there is no information available regarding the "Table-Sequence" method or papers that have utilized it. Therefore, I cannot provide a list of papers or links to their code as requested.

The final answer is that there is no relevant information in the provided context to address the query.
