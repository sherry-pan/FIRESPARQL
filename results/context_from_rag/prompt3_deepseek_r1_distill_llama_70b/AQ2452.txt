Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the axCell model for benchmarking purposes?" using the provided ORKG RDF data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The question is asking about code references in papers, specifically those that have used the axCell model for benchmarking. So, the key entities and properties here are:

- "code references"
- "papers"
- "axCell model"
- "benchmarking purposes"

Now, I need to look through the provided RDF data to find entities and properties related to these terms. Let me go through each part of the context information.

Looking at the first file, I see several resources like R147244, R147246, etc. R147244 has a HAS_VALUE of "93.9", which doesn't seem relevant. R147246 is linked to authors and a year, which also doesn't directly relate to code or benchmarking.

Moving to the second file, there's a resource R283709 which is a "Journal Article" and has various predicates like P5044, P41928, etc. It mentions "method", "solution proposal", "entity extraction", and "Graph analytics; Horizon 2020; Keyphrase extraction; Knowledge graph; Named entity recognition; Natural language processing; Text mining; Unsupervised learning" under P3000. This seems related to methods and techniques, possibly benchmarking.

R283710 is another resource with authors and publication details. It doesn't directly mention code or benchmarking but is part of the same dataset.

I also notice that the context includes steps for a process involving term expansion, named entity recognition, and filtering. This might be part of a method used in benchmarking.

Now, I need to find entities or properties related to "code references" and "benchmarking". Since the question is about finding code in papers that used axCell for benchmarking, I'm looking for papers (resources of type "Journal Article") that have used specific models (like axCell) and have code references.

Looking through the data, I don't see any direct mention of "axCell" or "code references". However, R283709 mentions "method" and "solution proposal", which could be related to models used in benchmarking. It also lists various techniques, some of which might involve code.

Since the exact model "axCell" isn't present, I might need to consider similar models or methods. The steps mentioned in the first file (like using SciBERT and k-means) could be part of benchmarking processes, so resources related to those steps might be relevant.

I'll have to retrieve the top entities related to benchmarking and models. From the data, R283709 and R283710 are journal articles that discuss methods and could be candidates. They might have links to code through their methods or solutions.

In terms of properties, P3000 in R283709 includes "benchmarking" as part of its string, so that's a relevant predicate. Similarly, P97003 is "method", which could relate to models.

Putting this together, the extracted terms are "code references", "papers", "axCell model", and "benchmarking purposes". The candidates would be the resources and properties that are related to these terms, even if they don't explicitly mention "axCell".

So, the JSON output should group these terms and list the relevant URIs with their labels and types. Since "axCell" isn't present, I'll include the closest matches from the data, which are the journal articles and their related methods and benchmarking predicates.
