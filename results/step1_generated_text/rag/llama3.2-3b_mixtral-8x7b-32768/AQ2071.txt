Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the FG fine-grained gate model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg#>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp#>
    PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp#>

    SELECT?paper?code?link
    WHERE {
   ?paper orkp:hasBenchmark orkp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
   ?benchmark orkp:hasCode orkp:HAS_CODE?code.
   ?paper orkp:hasCode orkp:HAS_CODE?code.
   ?code orkg:hasLink?link.
    FILTER (STR(?paper) = "Paper on FG fine-grained gate model" OR STR(?paper) = "Another Paper on FG fine-grained gate model")
    }
    ```



## Step 1: Understand the context and the question
The question asks for links to code used in papers that benchmark the FG fine-grained gate model. The context provides the entities and properties mentioned in the question, as well as candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to these.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant entities and properties
From the context, we can identify the following entities and properties:
- Entities: FG fine-grained gate model, benchmark, code, papers
- Properties: has benchmark, has code, has link

## Step 3: Determine the relationships between entities and properties
Based on the context, we can determine the following relationships:
- The FG fine-grained gate model has benchmarks.
- Benchmarks have code.
- Papers have code.
- Code has links.
- Papers are related to the FG fine-grained gate model.

## Step 4: Construct the SPARQL query
Using the identified entities, properties, and relationships, we can construct the SPARQL query:
```sparql
SELECT?paper?code?link
WHERE {
   ?paper orkp:hasBenchmark orkp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
   ?benchmark orkp:hasCode orkp:HAS_CODE?code.
   ?paper orkp:hasCode orkp:HAS_CODE?code.
   ?code orkg:hasLink?link.
    FILTER (STR(?paper) = "Paper on FG fine-grained gate model" OR STR(?paper) = "Another Paper on FG fine-grained gate model")
}
```

The final answer is: ```sparql
