Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the CATTS-XSUM model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P31?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P32?code.
      ?paper orkgp:P50049?eval.
       FILTER(REGEX(?eval, "CATTS-XSUM"))
     }<|eot_id|>
