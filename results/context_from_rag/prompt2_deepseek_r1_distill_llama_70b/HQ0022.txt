Okay, I need to figure out if the paper titled "Disambiguating authors in citations on the web and authorship correlations" uses cosine similarity. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

First, I'll check the RDF data. The context includes two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a method with five steps involving seed terms, expansion using SciBERT and k-means, NER with CRF, and filtering. It doesn't mention cosine similarity.

Next, R284316 is about a paper titled "In this work we address the problem of extracting quality entity knowledge..." which discusses using a probabilistic model called jpark. This model uses background knowledge from YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata. The paper evaluates jpark with tools like Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight. Again, no mention of cosine similarity here.

Looking at the other resources, R147244 has a value of 93.9, which might be an accuracy score, but it's not related to cosine similarity. The other resources list authors and publication details but don't mention the specific similarity measure.

Since neither of the papers in the context use cosine similarity, the answer is no. The paper in question doesn't employ cosine similarity based on the provided data.

The paper "Disambiguating authors in citations on the web and authorship correlations" does not employ cosine similarity based on the provided context information.
