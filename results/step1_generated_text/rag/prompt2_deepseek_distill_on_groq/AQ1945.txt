Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the code links in papers that use the H-NLI model in any benchmark?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "H-NLI model" and "code links." The property involved is "use" since the question is about papers that use the model. So, I have two main terms: "H-NLI model" and "code links."

Next, I need to compute the similarity between these terms and the entities in the RDF data. Looking at the context, I see mentions of models like SVM and datasets like MNIST, but nothing directly about H-NLI. However, there are papers with URLs and DOIs, which might be relevant for code links.

For "H-NLI model," I'll look for similar models or mentions. The context doesn't have H-NLI, but there are other models like SVM and techniques like validation research. I'll consider these as potential candidates with lower similarity scores.

For "code links," the context provides URLs and DOIs in the papers, such as "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075." These are specific resources, so they'll have higher similarity scores.

Now, I'll select the top candidates. Since H-NLI isn't present, I'll include the most relevant models and papers. For code links, the URLs and DOIs from the papers are the best matches.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their candidates, ensuring the correct types and URIs are used.
