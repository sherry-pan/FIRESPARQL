Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The query is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the CRF with sentence expansion model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of CRF or sentence expansion. From the context, I see that in the first file, there's a step that mentions using a CRF algorithm. Specifically, Step 4 says, "We apply our NER approach and thereby identify new entity candidates. We use a CRF algorithm to learn the patterns of the data." So, CRF is definitely mentioned here.

Next, I need to find any papers or resources related to this. Looking at the second file, there's a resource R284316 which is a journal article titled "validation research" and uses techniques like NER and entity linking. The description talks about improving annotations using a probabilistic model called jpark, which handles NIL information. This seems related to NER and could be using CRF, but it's not explicitly stated. However, since the first context mentions CRF, I can infer that this paper might be relevant.

Another resource is R284317, which is another journal article. It mentions authors like Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta, published in 2021. The URL is provided, which is a link to the paper. This could be another relevant paper, but again, it's not explicitly clear if they used CRF with sentence expansion.

I also notice that in the first file, there are steps that involve term and sentence expansion (TSE) using SciBERT and k-means. This is in Step 2. So, the method described in the first context uses both CRF and sentence expansion, which matches the query's request.

Now, I need to extract the relevant terms from the query. The key entities are "CRF", "sentence expansion", "papers", and "code links". 

For the candidates, I'll look for any papers in the context that are related to CRF and sentence expansion. From the context, R147652 is about a method that uses CRF and sentence expansion. R284316 and R284317 are papers that might be related, but without explicit mention of CRF, it's a bit uncertain. However, since the first context's method uses CRF, I can associate the papers connected to that method.

I'll structure the JSON output as per the example, grouping the results by the extracted terms. Each term will have its top candidates with URIs, labels, scores, types, and RDF types.

I should also ensure that the URIs use the correct prefixes: "orkgr:" for resources, "orkgc:" for classes, and "orkgp:" for properties. The labels should be under "rdfs:label", and the types should be correctly assigned as "Resource", "Class", or "Predicate".

Finally, I'll include the DOI links as URLs where applicable, even though the example didn't include them, but the user asked for code links. However, in the context, only R284317 has a URL, so I'll include that.
