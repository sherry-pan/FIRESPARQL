Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the CAIT-XS-36 model?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?model    orkgp:HAS_MODEL      orkgp:R147244.
       FILTER(REGEX(?model, "CAIT-XS-36"))
      ?benchmark       orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION     ?eval.
      ?cont           orkgp:P31              ?eval.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
       OPTIONAL {?cont      orkgp:HAS_CODE         ?code.}
      ?paper          orkgp:P31              ?cont.
       OPTIONAL {?paper      orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE ?code.}
     } 

    Note: The above SPARQL query is not necessarily the optimal query, but it should be a correct one. The optimal query may vary based on the specific requirements of the application. 

    This problem can be solved by using the following approach:
    1. Get the papers that contain the CAIT-XS-36 model.
    2. Get the code from each of these papers.
    3. Return the links to the code.

    The SPARQL query above is a possible implementation of this approach.
    The query first filters the papers that contain the CAIT-XS-36 model. Then, it gets the code from each of these papers. Finally, it returns the links to the code.
    However, the query also returns the code from the papers that do not contain the CAIT-XS-36 model, because the `OPTIONAL` clause in the query allows this. Therefore, the query may not be optimal. 

    To optimize the query, we can add a filter to exclude the papers that do not contain the CAIT-XS-36 model. We can do this by adding a filter to the `SELECT` clause. For example:
    SELECT?code
    WHERE {
     ?model    orkgp:HAS_MODEL      orkgp:R147244.
      FILTER(REGEX(?model, "CAIT-XS-36"))
     ... (rest of the query remains the same)
    }
    This query is more efficient because it only returns the code from the papers that contain the CAIT-XS-36 model. 

    However, this query still returns the code from the papers that do not contain the CAIT-XS-36 model, because the `OPTIONAL` clause in the query allows this. Therefore, we need to add another
