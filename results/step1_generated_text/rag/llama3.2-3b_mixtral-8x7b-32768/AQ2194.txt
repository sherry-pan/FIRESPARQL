Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Adaptive Input Large model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    SELECT?paper?code
    WHERE {
     ?paper a orkg:Paper.
     ?paper orkg:HAS_PAPER?p.
     ?p orkg:UTILIZES?model.
     ?model orkg:AdaptiveInputLargeModel.
     ?paper orkg:HAS_CODE?code.
    }
    ``` 
    Note: The above SPARQL query is generated based on the provided input question and context. The actual SPARQL query might need to be adjusted based on the actual data in the ORKG. 

    The provided SPARQL query will return all papers that have utilized the Adaptive Input Large model and have links to their code. The?paper variable represents a paper, and the?code variable represents the link to the paper's code. 

    This query uses the following predicates:
    - orkg:Paper: Represents a paper.
    - orkg:HAS_PAPER: Represents a paper that has been published.
    - orkg:UTILIZES: Represents the action of utilizing a model.
    - orkg:AdaptiveInputLargeModel: Represents the Adaptive Input Large model.
    - orkg:HAS_CODE: Represents a paper that has a link to its code. 

    The query starts by selecting all papers that have been published (orkg:HAS_PAPER). Then it filters these papers to only include those that have utilized the Adaptive Input Large model (orkg:UTILIZES). Finally, it filters the papers to only include those that have a link to their code (orkg:HAS_CODE). 

    The?paper and?code variables are used to represent the selected papers and their corresponding code links, respectively. 

    The query is designed to be executed on the ORKG, which is expected to contain the necessary data to answer the input question. 

    Note that the actual query might need to be adjusted based on the actual data in the ORKG. 

    The query is written in SPARQL, which is a query language for RDF data. 

    The query is designed to be executed on a triple store, which is a type of database that stores RDF data. 

    The query uses the following variables:
    -?paper: Represents a paper.
    -?code: Represents a link to a paper's code. 

    The query is designed to return the following information:
    - The selected papers.
    - The links to their code. 

    The query is designed to be executed in a single query, which means that it does not require multiple passes over the data. 

    The query is designed to be efficient, which
