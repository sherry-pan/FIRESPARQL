Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the TCN model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/>
     SELECT?paper?paperTitle?codeReference 
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:HAS_METHOD orkg:TCN.
    ?paper orkg:HAS_BENCHMARK.
    ?paper orkg:HAS_IMPLEMENTATION?codeReference.
     }<|eot_id|>
