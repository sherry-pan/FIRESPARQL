Okay, so I have this query to answer: "What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the WMT2016 English-Russian dataset, including the metric and its value?" I need to figure this out using the provided ORKG data dump. Let me start by understanding what the data contains.

Looking at the context information, I see several resources with their URIs, labels, and some properties. The first part of the data includes resources like R76244 labeled "Team 2 Sub tasks 1 English" and R75430 labeled "IBM Journal of Research and development." There's also R75840 about factors influencing evidence-based decision-making in humanitarian response. The second part of the data seems to list contributors and some references, like Natalia Manola and Jochen Schirrwagen, and a link to a Codalab competition.

Now, the query is about the WMT2016 English-Russian dataset. I don't see any direct mention of WMT2016 or the specific language pair in the provided data. The resources listed are about various topics like similarity measures, venues, contributions, and papers, but nothing specific to machine translation benchmarks or the WMT competition.

I should check if any of the resources relate to benchmarks or metrics. R76244 is about a team's subtask, but it's labeled in English, not Russian. R75430 is a journal, which might publish benchmark results, but without more context, I can't confirm. R75840 is about humanitarian response, which doesn't seem relevant.

Looking at the second part, R76324 describes a SemEval-2020 task about word similarity, which is a different competition. R76971 has multiple properties linking to other resources, but none seem to relate to WMT or translation tasks.

Since the data doesn't mention WMT2016 or the English-Russian dataset, I can't extract any relevant entities or properties. Therefore, there are no similar entities or properties to retrieve based on the given data.
