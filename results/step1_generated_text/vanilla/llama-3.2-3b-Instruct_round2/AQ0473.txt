     SELECT?title?id
     WHERE {
      ?paper a orkg:Paper.
      ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
      ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset?dataset.
      ?dataset orkg:hasDataset rotowire:ContentSelection.
      ?paper orkg:hasTitle?title.
      ?paper orkg:hasId?id.
       FILTER (strContains(?title, "Rotowire"))
