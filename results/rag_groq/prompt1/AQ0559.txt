Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the query: "Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the AAPD dataset?" using the provided context information. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of research papers. I see several resources labeled as "Paper" in the context. For example, R211524 is a Paper with the title "NNE: A dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire". Similarly, R211319 is a Paper titled "Component for template r206311", and R211327 is another Paper, but its title isn't provided in the context. 

Next, I need to check if any of these papers mention the AAPD dataset. However, scanning through the context, I don't see any references to the AAPD dataset. The papers mentioned are about NNE dataset, template components, and others, but none seem related to AAPD.

Since there's no information about the AAPD dataset in the context, I can't find any relevant papers that have performed benchmarks on it. Therefore, the result is an empty list.

The query asks for research papers that have performed benchmarks on the AAPD dataset. Upon examining the provided context, there are several research papers mentioned, such as "NNE: A dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire" and others. However, none of these papers reference the AAPD dataset. Therefore, there are no relevant papers to include in the list.
