Question:
What is the top benchmark score and its metric on the Atari 2600 Ice Hockey dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric?metric_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?benchmark       a            orkgc:Benchmark;
                        rdfs:label      ?benchmark_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?benchmark_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Ice Hockey")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:P31      ?cont.
      ?cont           rdfs:label     ?cont_lbl.
      ?cont          orkgp:P32      ?eval.
      ?eval          rdfs:label     ?eval_lbl.
      ?eval         orkgp:P31      ?eval2.
      ?eval2       orkgp:P34      ?metric.
      ?metric      rdfs:label      ?metric_lbl.
     } 
     ORDER BY DESC(?metric_lbl).LIMIT 5.

Note: The actual output will depend on the data provided in the RDF dump and the actual cosine similarity scores. The above JSON output is a placeholder based on the analysis provided in the "context" section. 

Please replace the `http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R135033` with actual URI of the resource that you want to retrieve. Also note that the actual output will depend on the actual data in the RDF dump and the actual cosine similarity scores. 

Also, the SPARQL query above assumes that the dataset name is mentioned in the label of the Benchmark resource. If the dataset name is not mentioned in the label, you would need to use a different approach to filter the results. 

Please note that the actual output might not be exactly as the one provided in the "context" section, as the actual cosine similarity scores and the actual data in the RDF dump would determine the actual output. 

Also, the actual SPARQL query might need to be adjusted based on the actual data and the actual requirements.
