Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user is asking for a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Atari 2600 Skiing dataset. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of research papers, their titles, IDs, and any connections to the Atari 2600 Skiing dataset. 

Looking at the context, I see two main resources: R147246 and R283710. Both are papers with their respective authors and publication details. 

For R147246, the authors include Ligia Sierra, Betty L LÃ³pez, Flavio Forni, Maria Angela Vandelli, Michele Zoli, and Antonietta Vilella. It was published in 2015, volume 6. The title isn't directly provided, but the analysis mentions 32,090 funded projects and the use of keyphrase extraction and NER models. 

R283710 is another paper with authors Yuanyuan Wu, Mengxing Huang, Zhaocheng Tu, and Siling Feng, published in 2021, volume 8. The title isn't given, but the paper involves graph analytics, keyphrase extraction, named entity recognition, etc.

I don't see any direct mention of the Atari 2600 Skiing dataset in the context. The context talks about datasets like MNIST and methods like SVM, but not Atari. 

Since the context doesn't have information about the Atari 2600 Skiing dataset, I can't find any relevant papers from the provided data. Therefore, the candidates for the dataset and the papers related to it would be empty in the JSON output.

I'll structure the JSON as per the example, extracting the terms "research paper titles", "IDs", "benchmarked models", and "Atari 2600 Skiing dataset". Each term will have an empty list of candidates since there's no relevant data in the context.

  "question": "Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Atari 2600 Skiing dataset?",
  "extracted_terms": {
    "research paper titles",
    "IDs",
    "benchmarked models",
    "Atari 2600 Skiing dataset"
  },
  "candidates": {
    "research paper titles": [],
    "IDs": [],
    "benchmarked models": [],
    "Atari 2600 Skiing dataset": []
  }
}
