Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the UCF101 (finetuned) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?metric,?evaluator
     WHERE {
       orkgp:R134744 orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?eval.
      ?eval orkgp:P31032?metric.
      ?eval orkgp:P31033?evaluator.
       FILTER(REGEX(STR(?evaluator), "UCF101"))
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(?evaluator) LIMIT 5
     ``` 
    Note: The above code is in SPARQL, a query language for RDF data. It is used to retrieve the evaluation metrics and evaluators for the UCF101 dataset. The `SELECT DISTINCT?metric,?evaluator` statement is used to select the distinct evaluation metrics and evaluators. The `WHERE` clause is used to filter the results based on the UCF101 dataset. The `FILTER(REGEX(STR(?evaluator), "UCF101"))` statement is used to filter the results to only include evaluators that contain the string "UCF101". The `ORDER BY DESC(?evaluator)` statement is used to sort the results in descending order by the evaluator. The `LIMIT 5` statement is used to limit the results to the top 5 evaluators. 

    Note: The above code is a query to the ORKG dataset. It will return the evaluation metrics and evaluators for the UCF101 dataset. The results will be in the format of a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the evaluation metric and the evaluator. 

    Please note that the actual output of the query may vary based on the data available in the ORKG dataset.
