Question:
List the code links in papers that use the GPT-2 (small) model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?code
WHERE {
 ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
            rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "GPT-2 (small)")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:P31               ?model.
 ?cont           rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
  OPTIONAL {?cont           orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.}
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont.
 ?paper         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
  OPTIONAL {?paper      orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.}
}
```    end
    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve code links in papers that use the GPT-2 (small) model in any benchmark. The query first filters the resources with the label "GPT-2 (small)". Then, it retrieves the papers that use the filtered model. For each paper, it checks if the paper has a source code. If it does, the code link is added to the results. The `OPTIONAL` clause is used to avoid errors if a paper does not have a source code. The `?code` variable is used to store the retrieved code links. The query returns the top 5 similar candidate entities or properties based on the cosine similarity scores. The results are filtered to only include the code links in papers that use the GPT-2 (small) model in any benchmark.<|eot_id|>
