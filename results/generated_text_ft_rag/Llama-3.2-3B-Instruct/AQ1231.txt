Question:
What is the top benchmark score and its metric on the Cheetah, run (DMControl500k) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?metric?metric_lbl (COUNT(?eval) AS?score)
     WHERE {
       orkgc:R135033 orkgp:P30?eval.
      ?eval orkgp:P31?metric.
      ?metric orkgp:P32?metric_lbl.
       FILTER(REGEX(STR(?metric_lbl), "Accuracy"))
     }
     GROUP BY?metric?metric_lbl
     HAVING (COUNT(?eval) > 1)
     ORDER BY DESC(?score)
     LIMIT 1
``` 
    The provided SPARQL query retrieves the top benchmark score and its metric on the Cheetah, run (DMControl500k) dataset. The query filters for evaluations with the metric "Accuracy", groups the results by metric and label, and orders the results in descending order of score. The LIMIT 1 clause is used to retrieve only the top score. 

    This query will return a single result, which is the top benchmark score and its metric on the Cheetah, run (DMControl500k) dataset. 

    The query is designed to work with the provided ORKG RDF data dump and is based on the analysis of the input question and the context information. 

    The output of the query will be a single row with the top benchmark score and its metric, which can be used to answer the input question. 

    The query can be executed using a SPARQL query engine or a programming language that supports SPARQL queries. 

    The output of the query will be in the format of a single row with the following columns:

    * metric: The metric of the top benchmark score.
    * metric_lbl: The label of the metric of the top benchmark score.
    * score: The score of the top benchmark score. 

    The score is calculated as the count of evaluations with the metric. 

    The query is designed to work with the provided ORKG RDF data dump and is based on the analysis of the input question and the context information.
