Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the CRF with sentence expansion model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?paper?paperCode 
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgc:Contribution.
  SERVICE orkp:sparql{
   ?paper orkgp:UTILIZES_CRF_WITH_SENTENCE_EXPANSION_MODEL.
   ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?paperCode.
  }
}
```sparql
    Note: The actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the data in the ORKG. 

    The actual structure of the data in the ORKG is not provided, so I will assume that the data is structured as follows:
    * The Contribution nodes in the graph have a URI of the form "orkgr:<id>" where <id> is a unique identifier for the contribution.
    * The predicates in the graph have URIs of the form "orkgp:<id>" where <id> is a unique identifier for the predicate.
    * The Contribution nodes have a property "orkgp:HAS_PAPER" that is a list of URIs of the form "orkgp:<id>" where <id> is a unique identifier for the paper.
    * The papers have a property "orkgp:UTILIZES_CRF_WITH_SENTENCE_EXPANSION_MODEL" that is a boolean value indicating whether the paper utilizes the CRF with sentence expansion model.
    * The papers have a property "orkgp:HAS_CODE" that is a URI of the form "orkgp:<id>" where <id> is a unique identifier for the code.
    * The Contribution nodes have a property "orkgp:UTILIZES" that is a list of URIs of the form "orkgp:<id>" where <id> is a unique identifier for the paper that the contribution utilizes.

Based on this structure, the SPARQL query can be generated as follows:

```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?paper?paperCode 
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgc:Contribution.
 ?paper orkgp:UTILIZES_CRF_WITH_SENTENCE_EXPANSION_MODEL.
