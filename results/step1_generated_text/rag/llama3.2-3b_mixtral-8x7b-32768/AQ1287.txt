What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset Atari 2600 Enduro?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    SELECT?metric?value WHERE {
   ?dataset orkgp:hasBestResult?result.
   ?result orkgp:hasMetric?metric.
   ?result orkgp:hasValue?value.
   ?dataset orkgp:hasDataset?dataset.
    FILTER (?metric = "top" AND?value IS NOT NULL)
    }
    FILTER (?dataset = "orkgr:R147244")
    }
