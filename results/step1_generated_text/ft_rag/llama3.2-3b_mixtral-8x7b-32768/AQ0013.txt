Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the CommonsenseQA dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Resource;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
           FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "CommonsenseQA")
          ?dataset       orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset_has_dataset.
          ?dataset_has_dataset       orkgp:HAS_MODEL      ?model.
          ?model       rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
      }
    Note: The query returns all the models that have been evaluated on the specified dataset. The models are identified by their URIs, which are represented as labels in the query output.
    Note: The query uses the `str(?dataset_lbl)` filter to ensure that the correct dataset is selected, since the dataset's label is used to identify it in the ORKG. 
    Note: The query uses the `?model       orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset_has_dataset.` line to get all the models that have been evaluated on the specified dataset.
