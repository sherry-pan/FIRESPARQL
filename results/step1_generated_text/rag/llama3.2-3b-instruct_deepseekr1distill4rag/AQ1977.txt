Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the STREET model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgc: <http://orkg.org/resource/city>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://orkg.org/resource/graph>
PREFIX orkp: <http://orkp.org/predicate/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkg.org/predicate/graph/>

SELECT?p?o
WHERE {
 ?o orkgp:hasCodeReference?p.
 ?o orkgc:hasBenchmarkingPurpose?b.
  FILTER (REGEX (STR(?b), "STREET") || REGEX (STR(?b), "SVM") || REGEX (STR(?b), "MNIST") || REGEX (STR(?b), "benchmarking"))
 ?b orkgp:hasProperty?c.
 ?c orkgp:hasType "Model".
  SERVICE orkgp:search {
    BIND (REGEX (STR(?b), "STREET") || REGEX (STR(?b), "SVM") || REGEX (STR(?b), "MNIST") || REGEX (STR(?b), "benchmarking") AS?filter)
   ?b orkgp:hasProperty?c.
    FILTER (?filter)
  }
}
