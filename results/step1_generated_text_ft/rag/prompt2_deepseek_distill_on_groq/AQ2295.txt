Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking for a list of papers that used the Prior noop model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information. The context has two main sections, each with RDF data. 

Looking at the first section, I see that it's about a resource R147652 which describes a method involving steps like seed terms, expansion, annotation, NER approach, and filtering. The steps mention things like SVM, MNIST, SciBERT, k-means, CRF algorithm, etc. There are also some entities linked, like authors and venues, but nothing about the Prior noop model or code links.

The second section is about resource R284316, which is a journal article titled "validation research" and "technique". The abstract discusses extracting entity knowledge using a model called jpark, which uses tools like Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL. It also mentions datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP. The authors are Rajesh Bhatia, Amit Gupta, etc., and there's a DOI link. Again, no mention of Prior noop or code links.

So, from the context, there's no information about the Prior noop model or any papers using it. The context talks about other models and methods but not the specific one the user is asking about. 

Therefore, based on the provided context, there are no relevant papers or code links related to the Prior noop model. The answer should reflect that no relevant information was found in the context.
