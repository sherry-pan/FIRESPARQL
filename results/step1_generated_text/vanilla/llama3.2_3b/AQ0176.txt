Question:
What models are being evaluated on the UrbanSound8k dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
     SELECT?model 
     WHERE {
       ?model orkg:isPartOf?dataset.
       ?dataset orkg:datasetName "UrbanSound8k".
       ?model orkg:isEvaluatedOn?evaluatedOn.
       ?evaluatedOn a orkg:Evaluation. 
       ?model orkg:label?modelLabel.
        FILTER (?modelLabel = "models" )
      } 
      GROUP BY?model 
      HAVING COUNT(?evaluatedOn) > 1 
      ORDER BY DESC(?evaluatedOn) DESC 
    LIMIT 10 
    Note: The SPARQL query is in a simplified form, the real query might be more complex, and it may require additional steps or modifications to work with the actual data. 

    Please note that the question asked is not a typical use case of SPARQL query, it is designed to test the understanding of the knowledge graph and the ability to generate a query based on the knowledge graph structure. 

    The SPARKG is designed to work with the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), which is a knowledge graph that represents scholarly contributions, including papers, authors, and citations. The knowledge graph is built on top of the DBpedia and YAGO ontologies. 

    The SPARQL query is generated based on the knowledge graph structure and the understanding of the input question. It queries the ORKG to get the models being evaluated on the UrbanSound8k dataset. The query first filters the models that are part of the UrbanSound8k dataset, then it filters the models that are evaluated on the UrbanSound8k dataset, and finally it groups the results by the model and orders them by the number of evaluations.
