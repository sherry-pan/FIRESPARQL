Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the ObjectNet dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/>

    SELECT?paper?title?id
    WHERE {
     ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
     ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset "http://orkg.org/orkg/dataset/ObjectNet".
     ?benchmark orkg:titles?title.
     ?benchmark orkg:CSVW_Number?id.
    }<|eot_id|>
