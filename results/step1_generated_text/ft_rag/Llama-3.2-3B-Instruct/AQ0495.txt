Question:
List the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the Penn Treebank (Word Level) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Penn Treebank (Word Level)")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                 rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?paper_lbl)
LIMIT 5;
```
