Question:
Which model has achieved the highest F1 score on the SQuAD1.1 dev benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>

SELECT?model?score 
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?f1_model.
 ?f1_model orkgp:ACHIEVED_HIGHEST_F1_SCORE?score.
 ?f1_model orkgr:R122689 orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?f1_benchmark.
 ?f1_benchmark orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?f1_evaluation.
 ?f1_evaluation a orkgc:Dataset.
  FILTER (str(?score) = "max")
}
```
    Note: The `str(?score)` filter is used to match the highest F1 score. This is a simplification and does not account for the full complexity of F1 score matching, but it serves the purpose of this task.

    In this query, we are assuming that the `str(?score)` filter will return the highest F1 score. In a real-world scenario, you would need to implement a more sophisticated method to match the F1 score. 

    Note that the `orkgp:HAS_MODEL` and `orkgp:ACHIEVED_HIGHEST_F1_SCORE` predicates are assumed to be part of the ORKG, but their actual URIs may vary depending on the specific implementation of the ORKG. 

    Also, the `orkgr:R122689` URI is assumed to be the correct resource ID for the SQuAD1.1 dev benchmark dataset, but its actual URI may vary depending on the specific implementation of the ORKG.

    Finally, the `orkgc:Dataset` class is assumed to be part of the ORKG, but its actual URI may vary depending on the specific implementation of the ORKG. 

    This solution assumes that the ORKG is well-structured and that the required predicates and resources are correctly linked. In a real-world scenario, you would need to implement additional error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure the correctness of the query. 

    This solution also assumes that the input question is well-formulated and that the required entities and properties are correctly extracted. In a real-world scenario, you would need to implement additional natural language processing techniques to extract the required entities and properties from the input question. 

    Please
