Question:
Which model has achieved the highest Top 1 Accuracy score on the ImageNet V2 benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc/>
SELECT?model?score
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?score.
 ?score orkgp:HAS_SCORE?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgr:R122689.
  FILTER (STR(?score) ~ "Top 1 Accuracy" && REGEX("\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?")).
  FILTER (STR(?dataset) = "ImageNet V2" && REGEX("\\d+(?:\\.\\d+)?"))
}
``` 
    Note that you may need to modify the SPARQL query to match the actual structure of the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) dataset. The provided SPARQL query is based on the context you provided. 

    Note that the provided SPARQL query assumes that the "Score" property (orkgp:HAS_SCORE) has a string value that contains the phrase "Top 1 Accuracy" and also a numerical value. The "Dataset" property (orkgp:HAS_DATASET) has a URI that matches the "ImageNet V2" resource (orkgr:R122689). The "Model" property (orkgp:HAS_MODEL) has a URI that matches the "Score" property (orkgp:HAS_SCORE). The "Model" property (orkgp:HAS_MODEL) has a URI that matches the "Score" property (orkgp:HAS_SCORE). 

    The SPARQL query filters the results to only include models with a "Top 1 Accuracy score" that is a numerical value and the "ImageNet V2 benchmark dataset" that has a numerical value. The query returns the model URI and the score value. 

    Please note that you should replace the PREFIX declarations with the actual prefixes used in the ORKG dataset.
