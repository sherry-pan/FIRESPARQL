    ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset "MPQA".
    ?paper orkg:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
    ?evaluation orkg:hasMethod?method.
    ?method orkg:hasImplementation?benchmark.
    ?paper orkg:hasId?paperId.
     FILTER (STRLIKE(?paperId, "PAPER-") || STRLIKE(?paperId, "PAPER-"))
     }
     LIMIT 100<|eot_id|>
