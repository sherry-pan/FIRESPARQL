Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user is asking for a list of models tested on the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std benchmark dataset. 

First, I'll look through the context data. I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a method with several steps, and R147244 has a value of 93.9. There are also resources like R283709 and R283710 which seem to be related to publications, with authors and years listed.

I need to extract relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "models" and "Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std benchmark dataset". The property is "tested on".

Looking through the context, I don't see any mention of "Habitat 2020" or "Object Nav". The datasets mentioned are "MNIST" and "MPQA benchmark dataset". The models mentioned include "SVM". 

Since the context doesn't have the specific dataset the user is asking about, I can't find exact matches. However, I can look for similar entities and properties. For example, "MNIST" is a dataset, so it's similar to "Habitat 2020". "SVM" is a model, so it's relevant to the models part.

I also see that there are predicates like P39020 which describes steps, and P27 which lists authors. These might not be directly relevant, but I can include them as possible properties related to testing or evaluation.

I'll structure the JSON output as per the example, grouping the candidates under each extracted term. For "Habitat 2020...", I'll include MNIST and MPQA as similar datasets. For "models", I'll include SVM. For "tested on", I'll include evaluation-related predicates.

I need to make sure the URIs use the correct prefixes: orkgr for resources, orkgp for properties, etc. Each candidate should have a URI, label, and type.

I'll list the top 5 candidates for each term, even if some are not exact matches, to provide the most relevant information possible from the given context.
