Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to answering the question about research papers that performed benchmarks on the RotoWire dataset. Let me break this down step by step.

First, the question is asking for a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs. So, I'm looking for properties that relate to papers, their identifiers, and their titles.

Looking through the JSON, I see properties like "has benchmark" and "evaluation." These seem relevant because benchmarks are a type of evaluation. If a paper has a benchmark, it likely used a dataset like RotoWire for that evaluation.

Next, the question mentions the RotoWire dataset specifically. I need a property that can link the benchmark to this dataset. The "has dataset" property makes sense here because it would indicate which dataset was used in the benchmark.

The question also asks for the papers' titles and IDs. The "title" property is directly relevant for the titles, and "has dataset" might also tie into how the dataset is used in each paper.

Additionally, "evaluation" is a broader term that could encompass the benchmarks performed. It might provide context on how the dataset was used in the research.

Putting it all together, the properties "has benchmark," "has dataset," "evaluation," and "title" seem to cover the necessary aspects: identifying the papers, their titles, and their use of the RotoWire dataset in benchmarks.

The most relevant properties from the JSON file that could help answer the question about research papers performing benchmarks on the RotoWire dataset are:

1. **has benchmark**: This property is relevant because it directly relates to the benchmarking process, which is a key aspect of the question.
2. **has dataset**: This property is important because it indicates the dataset used in the benchmark, which in this case is RotoWire.
3. **evaluation**: This property is relevant as it relates to the process of assessing or benchmarking, which is central to the question.
4. **title**: This property is necessary to identify the specific research papers by their titles.

These properties together can help identify papers that have performed benchmarks on the specified dataset.
