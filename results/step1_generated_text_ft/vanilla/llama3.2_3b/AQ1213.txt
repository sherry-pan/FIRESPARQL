Question:
What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset BC2GM?

     SELECT?metric?value WHERE {
       ?benchmark a orkg:Benchmark.
       ?benchmark orkg:name "BC2GM"@en.
       ?benchmark wot:hasMetric?metric.
       ?benchmark wot:hasValue?value.

       ?result owl:hasBestResult?benchmark.
        FILTER (STR(?metric) = "top").
        FILTER (STR(?value) = "best").
    } 
    Note: The benchmark results are in the format of "metric value", for example, "accuracy 0.96" or "F1 score 0.85". 
    Also, the results are in the format of "metric name value", for example, "top accuracy 0.96" or "top F1 score 0.85". 
    To make the query more efficient, the metric name and value are extracted from the benchmark result string, 
    and the metric name and value are compared to the "top" and "best" keywords, respectively. 
    The actual query may need to be adjusted based on the actual format of the benchmark results. 
    Please adjust the query according to the actual format of the benchmark results.
