Question:
What are the most commonly used benchmark datasets for the Entity Disambiguation research field?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?resource?resource_lbl
WHERE {
 ?context orkgp:P34062?resource.
 ?resource rdfs:label?resource_lbl.
  FILTER(REGEX(?resource_lbl, "Entity Disambiguation"))
}
ORDER BY (ASC(?resource_lbl))
LIMIT 10;
