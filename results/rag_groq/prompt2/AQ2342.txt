Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the DQNMMCe+SR model for benchmarking purposes?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "code references," "papers," and the specific model "DQNMMCe+SR." The properties involved are "used for benchmarking purposes."

Looking through the context, I see that there are two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a method involving steps for named entity recognition, which might relate to code references. R284316 is a journal article about extracting entity knowledge using various tools and models, which could be relevant to benchmarking.

I'll compute the similarity scores for each extracted term against the entities and properties in the RDF data. For "code references," the closest match is R147652, which discusses NER approaches. For "papers," R284316 is a journal article, so that's a good fit. The model "DQNMMCe+SR" isn't directly mentioned, but R284316 uses models like Stanford NER and Flair NER, which are related. The property "used for benchmarking purposes" aligns with R284316's evaluation methods.

Selecting the top candidates, I'll list the most relevant matches for each term. For "code references," R147652 is the top. For "papers," R284316 is the best match. The model and benchmarking terms also point to R284316 as the most relevant.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their top candidates, ensuring the correct URIs, labels, and types are included.
