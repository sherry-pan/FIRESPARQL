Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user is asking about the precision, recall, and F1 values of studies that used Naive Bayes with the Bag of Words feature to classify user feedback as feature requests.

First, I'll look through the context data to find relevant information. The context includes several RDF triples from ORKG. I see that there are resources related to studies, such as R147246 and R283710, which have properties like P27 (authors), P28 (issue), P29 (year), etc. There are also some metrics mentioned, like R147244 with a HAS_VALUE of "93.9", but it's not clear what that refers to.

Looking at the steps in R147652, it describes a method involving NER and CRF algorithms, but I don't see any direct mention of Naive Bayes or Bag of Words. The other resources, like R283709, talk about graph analytics, keyphrase extraction, and named entity recognition, but again, no mention of the specific algorithm or feature the user is asking about.

Since the context doesn't provide any information about Naive Bayes, Bag of Words, or their performance metrics, I can't extract any relevant terms or candidates. Therefore, the candidates for each extracted term will be empty.
