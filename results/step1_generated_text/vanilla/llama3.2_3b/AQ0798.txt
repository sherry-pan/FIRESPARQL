Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the MultiRC dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
     SELECT?metric
     WHERE {
       ?metric rdfs:label?label.
       ?metric orkg:isBenchmarkedBy <http://orkg.org/ontology/MultiRC>.
        FILTER (LANG(?label) = 'en').
        FILTER (STR(?label) = 'accuracy' OR STR(?label) = 'F1 score' OR STR(?label) = 'ROUGE score' OR STR(?label) = 'EM' )
      }  
      GROUP BY?metric
      HAVING COUNT(?metric) > 1  
      ORDER BY DESC(?metric) 
    LIMIT 1
    ``` 
    This code snippet generates a SPARQL query based on a given natural language question. The query is designed to query the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) for evaluation metrics commonly used when benchmarking models on the MultiRC dataset. The query filters results based on the language and specific labels of the metrics. It groups the results by metric, counts the occurrences of each metric, and orders the results in descending order. Finally, it limits the output to the top metric. 

    Here's a brief explanation of the query:

    1. The `PREFIX` statements define the prefixes for the ORKG and RDF Schema ontologies.
    2. The `SELECT` statement specifies that we want to retrieve the `?metric` variable.
    3. The `WHERE` clause filters the results based on the following conditions:
        - `?metric` has a label that is a string.
        - The label is in the English language (`LANG(?label) = 'en'`).
        - The label is one of the specified evaluation metrics (`STR(?label) = 'accuracy' OR STR(?label) = 'F1 score' OR STR(?label) = 'ROUGE score' OR STR(?label) = 'EM'`).
    4. The `GROUP BY` statement groups the results by the `?metric` variable.
    5. The `HAVING` clause filters the groups based on the count of metrics in each group (`COUNT(?metric) > 1`).
    6. The `ORDER BY` statement orders the results in descending order based on the `?metric` variable.
    7. The `LIMIT 1` statement limits the output to the top metric.

    This query is designed to retrieve the most commonly used evaluation metrics for the MultiRC dataset. 

    The query is well-structured and follows standard SPARQL query syntax. It uses filters to narrow down the results and groupings to retrieve the most relevant information. 

    However, the query may not cover all possible evaluation metrics used in benchmarking models on the MultiRC dataset. Additional metrics may need to be added to the filter conditions or the query may need to be modified to accommodate new metrics. 

    The query also assumes that the ORKG contains the necessary data for the MultiRC dataset. If the dataset is not available or the data is incomplete, the query may not produce accurate results. 

    In summary, this query is a good starting point for retrieving evaluation metrics for the MultiRC dataset, but it may need to be modified or extended to accommodate additional metrics or data. 

    Example use case:

    This query can be used in a variety of applications, such as:

    - Research papers: to retrieve evaluation metrics for a specific dataset or model.
    - Data analysis: to extract evaluation metrics for a dataset or model.
    - Recommendation systems: to retrieve evaluation metrics for a specific dataset or model.

    To use this query, simply copy and paste it into a SPARQL query editor or a tool that supports SPARQL queries, such as Jena or PySparQL. Replace the input question with your own question, and the query will generate the corresponding SPARQL query to retrieve the results. 

    Please note that this query is a simplified example and may need to be modified to accommodate specific requirements or data sources.
