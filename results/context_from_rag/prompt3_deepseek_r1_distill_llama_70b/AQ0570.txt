Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the WSC dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "research papers," "benchmark," and "WSC dataset." The properties involved are "include a benchmark for," which relates papers to the benchmark and dataset.

Looking through the context, I see that there are two main resources: R147246 and R283710. Both are papers with their respective authors and publication details. R147246 is from 2015 and has authors like Ligia Sierra, while R283710 is from 2021 with authors Yuanyuan Wu and others.

Next, I need to find if any of these papers mention a benchmark for the WSC dataset. The context doesn't explicitly mention "WSC dataset," but I can infer that if a paper discusses benchmarks, it might be related. R147652 describes a method involving benchmarks and datasets, which could be relevant.

I'll consider each extracted term and find similar entities or properties. For "research papers," the candidates are R147246 and R283710. For "benchmark," the relevant predicate is P5044, which is "Journal Article." For "WSC dataset," since it's not explicitly mentioned, I'll look for related datasets or benchmarks in the context, but none are found, so I'll note that.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON output, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including the top candidates with their URIs, labels, and types.
