Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WLPC dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
           FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WLPC")
          ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
          ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
          ?model         orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?cont.
          ?paper         rdfs:label               ?paper_lbl.
          ?paper         orkgp:HAS_ID           ?cont.
          ?paper         orkgp:HAS_TITLE         ?paper_lbl.
     }     


    Note that the answer to the input question is not included in the code above, as the task is to generate the SPARQL query to this question. However, the answer would be the list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WLPC dataset. 

    If you want to generate the answer, you would need to execute the SPARQL query above and provide the answer in the required format. 

    Note that the answer would be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a research paper title and its corresponding ID. The titles and IDs would be provided in the required format as specified in the prompt. 

    Here is an example of the answer format:
    Answer:
    [
      {
        "title": "Title of the first paper",
        "id": "ID of the first paper"
      },
      {
        "title": "Title of the second paper",
        "id": "ID of the second paper"
      },
     ...
    ]
    ] 

    You would need to execute the SPARQL query, parse the results, and format the answer according to the specified format. 

    However, the task is to generate the SPARQL query, not to generate the answer. Therefore, I will stop here.
