Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo (single model) model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT?p?o
WHERE {
 ?o a ora:Resource.
 ?o ora:hasLink?p.
 ?p a ora:Predicate.
 ?p ora:hasValue?o.
 ?o ora:label?oLabel.
  FILTER (?oLabel = "Journal Article" ||?oLabel = "BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo (single model)" ||?oLabel = "Code Repository" ||?oLabel = "Benchmark Dataset" ||?oLabel = "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075").
 ?o ora:hasModel?m.
 ?m ora:label?mLabel.
  FILTER (?mLabel = "BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo (single model)" ||?mLabel = "Journal Article" ||?mLabel = "Code Repository" ||?mLabel = "Benchmark Dataset").
}
```    Note: The SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG and returns a list of triples that match the query. The query filters for specific labels and models, and returns the values of the `hasLink` and `hasModel` properties. 

    Please note that the SPARQL query is just one possible query that can be generated based on the provided input question and context. The actual query may need to be modified based on the specific structure and data of the ORKG. 

    The output SPARQL query is not a direct translation of the provided JSON output, but rather a query that can be used to retrieve the same information. The JSON output is a human-readable representation of the query results, while the SPARQL query is a machine-readable query that can be executed directly on the ORKG. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to be executed using a SPARQL query engine, such as SPARQLDB or Virtuoso, and returns a list of triples that match the query. The query can be modified and optimized based on the specific requirements of the user and the ORKG. 

    Please note that the provided SPARQL query is for illustrative purposes only and may need to be modified to suit the specific requirements of the user and the ORKG. 

    The output SPARQL query is a direct translation of the provided JSON output, but it is not a direct translation of the original input question. The original input question was a natural language question, while the SPARQL query is a machine-readable query that can be executed directly on the ORKG.
