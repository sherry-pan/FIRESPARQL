Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the MFEC model?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/property/>
     SELECT?item?itemLabel?code?codeLabel
     WHERE {
    ?item wdt:P31 orkg:ScholarlyWork.
    ?item wdt:P276?paper.
    ?paper wdt:P138?benchmark.
    ?benchmark wdt:P171?link.
    ?item wdt:P108?code.
    ?code wdt:P577?codeLabel.
     FILTER (STR(?itemLabel) = "benchmark" )
     } 
     ORDER BY (?itemLabel)
     LIMIT 10
     ``` 
    Note that the provided query assumes the existence of certain entities in the knowledge graph, such as ScholarlyWork, paper, benchmark, link, code, and codeLabel. The query also filters the results to only include items with the label "benchmark" and limits the output to the first 10 results. 

    This query is not guaranteed to produce the exact output for the given input question, but it should be a good starting point for generating a SPARQL query that can retrieve relevant information from the ORKG. 

    Please note that the query may require adjustments based on the actual structure and content of the ORKG. 

    The query uses the following predicates:

    - P31: subclass of ( rdf:type )
    - P276: has bibliographic reference ( wdt:P276 )
    - P138: has benchmark ( wdt:P138 )
    - P171: has link ( wdt:P171 )
    - P108: has code ( wdt:P108 )
    - P577: has code label ( wdt:P577 )

    The query also uses the following prefixes:

    - orkg: <http://orkg.org/ontology/>
    - wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/property/>

    The query is written in the SPARQL 1.1 Query Language. 

    The query is designed to retrieve the following information:

    - The item (paper) that has a benchmark
    - The item label (title) of the paper
    - The code used in the paper
    - The code label of the code

    The query is filtered to only include papers that have a benchmark with a label "benchmark". The results are ordered by the item label and limited to the first 10 results. 

    This query may not be suitable for all use cases and may require adjustments based on the actual structure and content of the ORKG.
