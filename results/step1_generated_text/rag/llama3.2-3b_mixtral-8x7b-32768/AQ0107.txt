Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the Natural Questions (short) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?m
     WHERE {
    ?m a ora:Model.
    ?m ora:hasBenchmark "orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK".
    ?m ora:hasBenchmark "orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION".
     }
    Note: The actual output may vary slightly based on the actual implementation of the model and the data in the ORKG. The query provided is a possible query that would retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 

    This problem requires the use of the provided context to generate the SPARQL query. The context provides the necessary information to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG to the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The query is based on the information provided in the context, and it is designed to retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 

    The problem can be solved by following these steps:
    1. Identify the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    2. Use the provided context to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    3. Generate a SPARQL query based on the linked entities and properties.

    The provided context contains the necessary information to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG to the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The context provides the following information:
    - The extracted terms from the question, which are "Natural Questions (short) dataset", "models", and "benchmarked on".
    - The candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    - The context also provides the necessary information to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG to the entities and properties mentioned in the question, such as the URI of the "Natural Questions (short) dataset" resource, the URIs of the "models" and "benchmarked on" properties, and the URIs of the "HAS_MODEL" and "HAS_BENCHMARK" resources.

    By using this context, we can generate a SPARQL query that retrieves the correct answer to the input question. The query is based on the information provided in the context, and it is designed to retrieve the models that have been benchmarked on the Natural Questions (short) dataset. 

    The query is as follows:
    SELECT?m
    WHERE {
   ?m a ora:Model.
   ?m ora:hasBenchmark "orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK".
   ?m ora:hasBenchmark "orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION".
    }
    This query retrieves the models that have been benchmarked on the Natural Questions (short) dataset by querying the ORKG for resources that are instances of the ora:Model
