Question:
What models are being evaluated on the NCBI-disease dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
       orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
       FILTER (str(?dataset) = "NCBI-disease")
      ?dataset orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?eval.
      ?eval orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model.
      ?model rdfs:label?model_lbl.
     }    


    The final answer to the question "What models are being evaluated on the NCBI-disease dataset?" is given by the SPARQL query:
    ```
    SELECT?model?model_lbl
    WHERE {
      orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
      FILTER (str(?dataset) = "NCBI-disease")
     ?dataset orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?eval.
     ?eval orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model.
     ?model rdfs:label?model_lbl.
    }
    ```
    Note that the answer to the question is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context. It is assumed that the correct answer can be obtained by executing the above SPARQL query on the ORKG. 

    To obtain the answer, you need to execute the above SPARQL query using a SPARQL query engine. The answer will be a list of models being evaluated on the NCBI-disease dataset, along with their labels. 

    The answer may contain multiple models, and the labels may be different for each model. 

    To get the answer, execute the SPARQL query using a SPARQL query engine, such as SPARQLDB, and provide the output as the final answer. 

    The output of the SPARQL query will be a list of models, along with their labels, which can be used to answer the question "What models are being evaluated on the NCBI-disease dataset?"

    Please see below for the Python code that executes the SPARQL query and prints the answer: 
    ```python
    import orkgp

    query = """
    SELECT?model?model_lbl
    WHERE {
      orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
      FILTER (str(?dataset) = "NCBI-disease")
     ?dataset orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?eval.
     ?eval orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model.
     ?model rdfs:label?model_lbl.
    }
    """

    orkgp.execute_query(query)
    ````
    Note that the Python code is not executed here, but it can be executed using the orkgp library to get the answer to the question.
