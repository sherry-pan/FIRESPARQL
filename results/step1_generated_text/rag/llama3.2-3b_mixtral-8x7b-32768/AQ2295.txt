Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Prior noop model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/resource/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/predicate/>
    SELECT?paper?uri?code
    WHERE {
   ?paper orkgp:UTILIZES orkg:R44243.
   ?paper orkggp:HAS_PAPER?uri.
   ?paper orkggp:PUBLISHED_IN?publishedIn.
   ?publishedIn orkggp:CITED_BY?citedBy.
   ?citedBy orkggp:CITED_BY?citedBy2.
   ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
    }
    ```


## Step 1: Understand the context and the question
The context provides information about the terms (entities and properties) mentioned in the question, including the "Prior noop model", "papers", "utilized", and "links to their code". It also lists candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to these entities and properties.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant entities and properties
From the context, we can identify the following entities and properties:
- Entity: Prior noop model
- Property: utilized
- Entity: papers
- Property: HAS_PAPER
- Entity: links to their code
- Property: HAS_CODE

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query
To construct the SPARQL query, we need to find all papers that have utilized the Prior noop model and include the links to their code. We can use the following SPARQL query:

```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/resource/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/predicate/>

SELECT?paper?uri?code
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgp:UTILIZES orkg:R44243.
 ?paper orkggp:HAS_PAPER?uri.
 ?paper orkggp:PUBLISHED_IN?publishedIn.
 ?publishedIn orkggp:CITED_BY?citedBy.
 ?citedBy orkggp:CITED_BY?citedBy2.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
}
```

The final answer is
