Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Can you provide the highest benchmark result, including the metric and score, for the Gibson PointGoal Navigation dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "Gibson PointGoal Navigation dataset" and "benchmark result." The properties involved would be related to metrics and scores.

Looking through the context, I see that there are entries related to resources like R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a method with several steps, and R284316 talks about a journal article on entity knowledge extraction. However, I don't see any direct mention of the Gibson dataset or specific benchmark results.

Since the context doesn't provide the necessary information, I can't retrieve any relevant candidates. Therefore, the candidates for both extracted terms will be empty.
