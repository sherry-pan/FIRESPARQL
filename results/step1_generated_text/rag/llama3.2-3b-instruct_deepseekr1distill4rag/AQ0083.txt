WHERE {
 ?model rdfs:label?label.
 ?model rdfs:label "Model".
 ?dataset a rdfs:Class.
 ?dataset rdfs:label "Dataset".
 ?dataset orkggc:has_benchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark rdfs:label "WMT2014 English-German dataset".
 ?benchmark orkggc:has_model?model.
}
```    Note: The SPARQL query is not perfect, it's just a representation of what the query would look like. The actual query might need adjustments based on the actual structure of the data.<|eot_id|>
