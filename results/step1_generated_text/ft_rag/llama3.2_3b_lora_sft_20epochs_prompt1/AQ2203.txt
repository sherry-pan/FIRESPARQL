Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the 6-layer QRNN model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P31?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P31?paper.
      ?paper orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
       FILTER(REGEX(?benchmark, "6-layer QRNN"))
      ?benchmark orkgp:P5008?implementation.
      ?implementation orkgp:HAS_CODE?code
     }<|eot_id|>
