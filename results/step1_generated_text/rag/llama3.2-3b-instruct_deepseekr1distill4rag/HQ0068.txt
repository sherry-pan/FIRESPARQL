Question:
Which sectors are modeled as energy sectors and how often?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

    SELECT?sector?energy_sector?freq
    WHERE {
     ?sector orkgp:P39020?energy_sector.
     ?energy_sector orkgp:P28?freq.
      BIND(SUBSTR(STR(?freq), 4) AS?freq)
    }
    ``` 
    Note: The `BIND` function is used to extract the numerical value from the string representation of the frequency. This is a common technique in SPARQL queries when dealing with numerical values represented as strings. 

    This SPARQL query uses the `SELECT` statement to retrieve the sectors, energy sectors, and frequencies. The `WHERE` clause contains two triples: one that links sectors to energy sectors using the `modeled as` predicate, and another that links energy sectors to frequencies using the `how often` predicate. The `BIND` function is used to extract the numerical value from the string representation of the frequency. 

    The query assumes that the RDF data is stored in a graph with the specified prefixes. The actual prefixes and URIs may vary depending on the specific RDF data. 

    To execute this query, you can use a SPARQL query engine like SPARQLDB, SPARQL Query Engine, or any other SPARQL query processor. 

    Note that the query may not return accurate results if the RDF data is not properly formatted or if the relationships between the entities are not correctly modeled. 

    Also, the `SUBSTR` function is used to extract the numerical value from the string representation of the frequency. This is a common technique in SPARQL queries when dealing with numerical values represented as strings. 

    The `STR` function is used to convert the frequency value to a string, and the `SUBSTR` function is used to extract the numerical value from the string. 

    The `BIND` function is used to bind the extracted numerical value to a variable, which can then be used in the query. 

    The `SELECT` statement is used to specify the variables that should be returned in the query results. 

    The `WHERE` clause contains the triples that define the relationships between the entities.
