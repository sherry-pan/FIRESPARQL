Question:
What models are being evaluated on the WOS-11967 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>

SELECT?m (GROUP BY?m) 
WHERE {
 ?m orkgp:hasModel?m1.
 ?m orkgp:hasEvaluation?e.
 ?m orkgp:hasDataset?d.
 ?e orkgp:hasDataset?d.
 ?d orkg:RDFtype orkgc:Dataset.
}
```
    Note that this is just an example and may not be correct. You may need to modify the query based on the actual structure of the ORKG. 

    Also, the `?m` variable is used to denote the models, `?m1` is used to denote the model that a model is being evaluated on, `?e` is used to denote the evaluation, and `?d` is used to denote the dataset. The `?m` variable is grouped by itself to get the distinct models. 

    Please note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be modified based on the actual structure of the ORKG and the entities and properties mentioned in the question. 

    The context provided includes the following information:
    1. Terms (entities and properties) mentioned in the question.
    2. Candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
