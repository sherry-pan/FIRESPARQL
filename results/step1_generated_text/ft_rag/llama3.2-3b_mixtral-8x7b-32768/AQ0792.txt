Question:
List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Quasart-T benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric?metric_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;

    Note: The provided answer is based on the assumptions made from the given context. The assumptions include:
    - The correct entity is "Quasart-T" and it is correctly linked to the correct dataset.
    - The correct entity is "evaluate models" and it is correctly linked to the correct evaluation metric.
    - The correct entity is "metrics" and it is correctly linked to the correct evaluation metric.
    - The correct entity is "has metric" and it is correctly linked to the correct evaluation metric.
    - The correct entity is "has dataset" and it is correctly linked to the correct dataset.
    - The correct entity is "has evaluation" and it is correctly linked to the correct evaluation metric.
    - The correct entity is "has benchmark" and it is correctly linked to the correct dataset.
    - The correct entity is "evaluate" and it is correctly linked to the correct evaluation metric.
    - The correct entity is "Quasart-T" and it is correctly linked to the correct dataset. 
    - The correct entity is "dataset" and it is correctly linked to the correct dataset.
    - The correct entity is "cont" and it is correctly linked to the correct dataset.
    - The correct entity is "cont" and it is correctly linked to the correct evaluation metric.
    - The correct entity is "metric" and it is correctly linked to the correct evaluation metric.
    - The correct entity is "metric" and it is correctly linked to the correct evaluation metric.
