Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of F1 metric on the PubMed 20k RCT benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    SELECT?model?f1metric?dataset
    WHERE {
       ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?f1metric.
       ?f1metric orkgr:R122689 orkgr:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
        FILTER (STR(?f1metric) = "F1 metric").
        FILTER (STR(?dataset) = "PubMed 20k RCT").
    }
    ``` 
    Given the context, the SPARQL query should correctly identify the model that performed best in terms of F1 metric on the PubMed 20k RCT benchmark dataset. The query should link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG to answer the input question.

The final answer is: 
```
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
SELECT?model?f1metric?dataset
WHERE {
   ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?f1metric.
   ?f1metric orkgr:R122689 orkgr:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
    FILTER (STR(?f1metric) = "F1 metric").
    FILTER (STR(?dataset) = "PubMed 20k RCT").
}
```
