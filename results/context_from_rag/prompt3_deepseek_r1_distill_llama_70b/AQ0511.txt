Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the STS dataset. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of the STS dataset. Scanning the triples, I see entries related to other datasets like MNIST and MPQA, but there's no direct mention of STS. This might be a problem because without explicit data, I can't extract the necessary information.

Next, I'll check if there are any papers or resources that could be related. The context includes papers with URIs like R147246 and R283710, but none of them mention the STS dataset. The papers are about topics like keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition, not specifically benchmarking on STS.

Since the STS dataset isn't present in the provided data, I can't extract any relevant terms or entities. Without this information, I can't form a proper SPARQL query or retrieve any candidates. 

I should inform the user that based on the given context, there's no information available about the STS dataset. Therefore, I can't provide a list of papers that used it for benchmarks.

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the STS dataset or research papers that have performed benchmarks on it. Therefore, I cannot provide a list of such papers.

```json
{
  "question": "Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and ids, that have performed benchmarks on the STS dataset?",
  "extracted_terms": {
    "research papers",
    "STS dataset",
    "performed benchmarks on"
  },
  "candidates": {
    "research papers": [],
    "STS dataset": [],
    "performed benchmarks on": []
  }
}
```
