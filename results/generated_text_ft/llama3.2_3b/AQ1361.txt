Question:
What is the top benchmark score and its metric on the ModelNet40 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX dbpedia: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
     SELECT?score?metric
     WHERE {
    ?score?metric?dataset.
    ?dataset a orkg:Dataset.
    ?dataset rdfs:label "ModelNet40".
    ?score orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:hasMetric?metric.
    ?benchmark orkg:hasBenchmarkScore?score.
     FILTER (STRLEN(?metric) = 10) 
     FILTER (STRLEN(?dataset) = 11) 
     } 

    Please note that the question requires a top benchmark score and its metric, so the query must return only the top score and its metric. 
    The top score is defined as the highest benchmark score. The metric is defined as the string literal that corresponds to the metric of the top benchmark score. 

    Also, note that the query may return multiple results, but we assume that the top benchmark score is the first result in the result set. 
    We assume that the result set is sorted by the benchmark score in descending order. 

    Furthermore, the dataset name should be "ModelNet40", the question should be "What is the top benchmark score and its metric on the ModelNet40 dataset?", and the metric should be a string literal with a length of 10. 

    The query should be able to handle the case where there are no results, and it should return an empty result set in that case. 
    The query should also be able? to handle the case where there are multiple top benchmark scores, and it should return all of them along with their metrics. 
    The query should be able to handle the case where the metric is not a string literal with a length of 10, and it should return an empty result set in that case. 
    The query should be able to handle the prefixes of the dataset and the benchmark score, and it should be able to handle the filter conditions. 
    The query should be able to handle the sorting of the result set by the benchmark score in descending order. 

    The query should be able to handle the case where the top benchmark score is not found, and it should return an empty result set in that case. 
    The query should be able to handle the case where the metric is not found, and it should return an empty result set in that case. 
    The query should be able to handle the case where the dataset name is not found, and it should return an empty result set in that case.
