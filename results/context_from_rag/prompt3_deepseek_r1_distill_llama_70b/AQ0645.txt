Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the HoC dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "research papers" and "HoC dataset". The property mentioned is "include a benchmark for".

Looking through the context, I see that there are several resources related to papers, like R147246 and R283710, which have properties like P27 (authors), P28 (issue), P29 (year), etc. These are likely the research papers.

For the HoC dataset, I don't see it explicitly mentioned in the context. However, I can look for related terms. The closest might be "benchmark" or "dataset" related properties. There's a mention of "Benchmark MPQA" and "MPQA" in the example, but not HoC.

Since HoC isn't present, I'll consider that the dataset isn't in the provided data. Therefore, I can't find any specific papers that include a benchmark for HoC. But I can still list the papers present in the data, even if they don't relate to HoC.

So, the candidates for "research papers" would be R147246 and R283710. Each has authors, venue, year, etc. For "HoC dataset", since it's not present, I'll note that there are no matches.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON output as specified, grouping the candidates under each extracted term.
