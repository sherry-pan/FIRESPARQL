To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined:

1. **Extract entities and properties from the question**: The question mentions "top benchmark result", "metric", "value", "dataset", and "IMDb-B". However, the provided RDF data dump does not contain any information about "IMDb-B" or specific metrics and values directly related to the question. It does contain information about benchmarks, contributions, evaluations, and resources, including labels that mention "Benchmark ImageNet" and various evaluations with metrics like "Top 1 Accuracy".

2. **Retrieve similar entities or properties based on cosine similarity scores**: Since the question specifically asks about "IMDb-B" which is not present in the provided data, and given the nature of the data which focuses on ImageNet benchmarks and evaluations, we'll have to consider the entities and properties related to benchmarks and evaluations as the most relevant. The calculation of cosine similarity would typically involve comparing the vector representations of the question and the potential answers. However, given the absence of direct mentions of "IMDb-B" and the specific focus on ImageNet in the data, we'll consider entities related to benchmarks and evaluations as potentially relevant.

3. **Return the top similar entities or properties**: Given the data provided and the nature of the question, the most relevant entities seem to be those related to benchmarks and evaluations. However, without direct mentions of "IMDb-B" or specific metrics and values in the context, we can only infer potential relevance based on the types of entities and properties present.

Given these considerations and the specific format required for the answer, we would ideally calculate cosine similarity scores for entities and properties mentioned in the RDF data dump against the question. However, due to the constraints of the provided data and the question's specifics, we'll outline a hypothetical response based on the entities and properties that seem most relevant to the question's context, even though they do not directly answer the question about "IMDb-B".

Here's a hypothetical list of dictionaries in JSON format, considering the entities and properties that could be deemed relevant based on their types (benchmark, evaluation, etc.):

```json
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R135035",
    "label": "Benchmark ImageNet ReaL",
    "score": 0.6
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R134744",
    "label": "Benchmark ImageNet",
    "score": 0.55
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R135038",
    "label": "Benchmark ImageNet",
    "score": 0.55
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R134745",
    "label": "Evaluation Number of params_185.9M",
    "score": 0.5
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R134746",
    "label": "Evaluation Top 1 Accuracy_85.8%",
    "score": 0.5
  }
]
```

Please note, the scores provided are hypothetical and based on an assumption of relevance rather than actual cosine similarity calculations, which would require vector representations of the question and the entities/properties in the RDF data dump. The actual task of calculating cosine similarity would involve natural language processing techniques to vectorize the question and the potential answers, which is not directly feasible with the provided information.
