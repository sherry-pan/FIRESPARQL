Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the STL-10 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
     PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
     PREFIX dbpedia: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX schema: <http://schema.org/>
     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper a orkg:ResearchPaper.
    ?paper schema:hasDataset?dataset.
    ?dataset schema:name?name.
     filter(strcontains(?name, 'STL-10')).
    ?paper schema:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark schema:hasDataset?dataset2.
    ?dataset2 schema:name?name2.
     filter(strcontains(?name2, 'STL-10')).
    ?paper schema:hasTitle?title.
    ?paper orkg:id?id.
     }
