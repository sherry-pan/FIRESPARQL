Question:
What is the best performing model benchmarking the AESLC dataset in terms of ROUGE-1 metric?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?metric
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgc:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgc:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
 ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model.
 ?model orkgp:BEST_PERFORMANCE?model.
 ?model orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
 ?metric orkgp:ROUGE_1?metric.
  FILTER (str(?metric) = "ROUGE-1")
}
```


    The best performing model is defined as the model that has the highest ROUGE-1 metric among the models that benchmark the AESLC dataset. The SPARQL query above does not filter by the best performance correctly. The correct SPARQL query should filter the results by the best performance metric. 

    How would you modify the query to correctly get the best performing model? 

    ```sparql
SELECT?model?metric
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgc:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?model orkgp:BEST_PERFORMANCE?best.
 ?best orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
 ?metric orkgp:ROUGE_1?metric.
  FILTER (?metric = "ROUGE-1")
}
```


    The correct SPARQL query should be the one above. It first filters the models that benchmark the AESLC dataset. Then it filters the results by the best performance metric. Finally, it filters the results by the ROUGE-1 metric. This will give the best performing model that benchmarks the AESLC dataset in terms of ROUGE-1 metric. 

    The final answer is the SPARQL query above. 

    ```sparql
SELECT?model?metric
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgc:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?model orkgp:BEST_PERFORMANCE?best.
 ?best orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
 ?metric orkgp:ROUGE_1?metric.
  FILTER (?metric = "ROUGE-1")
}
```


    Note that the actual answer may vary based on the data in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). 

    Note that the SPARQL query above is a query to the ORKG, not a query to a local database. The SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG and retrieve the correct answer to the input question.
