Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Switch Transformer model and include the links to their code?" using the provided ORKG RDF data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "papers" and "Switch Transformer model". The action mentioned is "utilized, include links to their code". So, I'm looking for papers that have used the Switch Transformer and have code available.

Looking at the context data, I see several resources like R147246 and R283710 which are papers. Each of these has properties like P27 which lists authors, P28 which is the volume, P29 which is the year, and HAS_VENUE which links to the publication venue. However, I don't immediately see any mention of "Switch Transformer" in the provided data. That's a problem because without that specific model, I can't directly link the papers to it.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The context includes information about models and datasets, like SVM and MNIST, but not Switch Transformer. So, perhaps the data doesn't have the necessary information about the Switch Transformer model. That means I can't extract any relevant papers from this context.

But the task requires me to follow the steps, so I'll proceed as if I can find some related information. I'll look for papers (R147246 and R283710) and see if they have any links to code. The context doesn't mention code links, so I can't include those either.

Since the Switch Transformer isn't present, I might have to consider that the answer can't be accurately provided with the given data. However, to follow the structure, I'll create a JSON response that reflects this, perhaps indicating no matches found.

Alternatively, maybe I can structure the JSON to show that no relevant papers were found because the model isn't mentioned. But the example provided in the query expects a list, so I'll have to adjust accordingly.

In summary, the answer can't be fully provided because the Switch Transformer model isn't in the context data. Therefore, the JSON will reflect that no candidates were found for the given terms.
