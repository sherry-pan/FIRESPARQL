Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user's question is asking for a list of papers that have used the AlexNet and MultiGrasp models, along with links to their code. 

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "papers", "AlexNet", and "MultiGrasp model". The properties involved would be "utilized" and "links to their code". 

Looking at the context data, I see that there are several resources related to papers, such as R147246 and R283710, which have authors and publication details. However, I don't see any direct mentions of AlexNet or MultiGrasp. The context does include information about models like SVM and datasets like MNIST, but not the specific models the user is asking about.

Next, I need to find similar entities or properties in the RDF data. Since AlexNet and MultiGrasp aren't present, I'll look for related concepts. The term "models" appears in the context, so I can include that. For "papers", I can use the resources that represent papers, like R147246 and R283710. 

The property "utilized" might relate to how models are used in papers, so I'll consider predicates like P27 (authors) or P31 (types). For "links to code", the context doesn't have specific properties, but I can infer that it might relate to resources or venues where code is shared.

Now, I'll structure the JSON output. I'll group the candidates by each extracted term. For "papers", I'll list the resources that represent papers. For "AlexNet" and "MultiGrasp", since they aren't in the context, I'll note that there are no direct matches but include related models like SVM. For "links to code", I'll suggest possible properties that might be used to find code links, even if they aren't explicitly present.

I need to make sure the URIs use the correct prefixes and that each candidate includes the necessary details like URI, label, and type. Since the context doesn't have exact matches for the models, the results will be limited, but I'll provide the closest possible matches based on the available data.

Finally, I'll ensure the JSON structure is correct, with each term having its own list of candidates, each containing the required fields. I'll also make sure to use the appropriate RDF prefixes for URIs and types as specified.
