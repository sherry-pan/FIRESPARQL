Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Concept Mention Extraction model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?paper?paperCode
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_PUBLICATION orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK.
 ?paper orkgr:R147244 orkgr:R147246.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?paperCode.
}
```


    Note that the provided SPARQL query is just a sample and may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG. 

    This task requires the use of the provided context to generate a SPARQL query that can query the ORKG, and the query should be able to retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 

    The output SPARQL query should be able to filter papers that have used the Concept Mention Extraction model for benchmarking purposes, and then get the code references for those papers. 

    The query should also be able to handle the case where a paper may not have a code reference, and in that case, it should not include that paper in the results. 

    The query should be able to handle the case where a paper may have multiple code references, and in that case, it should include all of those code references in the results. 

    The query should also be able to handle the case where a code reference may not be related to the Concept Mention Extraction model, and in that case, it should not include that code reference in the results.
