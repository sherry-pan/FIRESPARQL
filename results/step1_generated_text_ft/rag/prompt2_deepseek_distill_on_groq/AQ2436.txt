Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking for links to code used in papers that benchmark the ImageNet + iNat on the WS-DAN model. 

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The key entities here are "ImageNet", "iNat", "WS-DAN model", and "code". The properties involved are "benchmark" and "provide links". 

Looking at the context data, I see that there are two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a method with five steps involving NER and CRF algorithms. R284316 is a journal article about extracting entity knowledge using NLP tools and models like Stanford NER and Flair NER. 

I need to find if there are any mentions of ImageNet, iNat, or WS-DAN in the context. From the provided data, I don't see any direct references to these terms. The context talks about datasets like MNIST and methods like SVM, but not ImageNet or iNat. Similarly, WS-DAN isn't mentioned either.

Since the context doesn't have the specific information the user is asking for, I can't retrieve any relevant entities or properties. Therefore, the candidates for each extracted term will be empty. 

I should structure the JSON response as per the example, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including their types and URIs. Since no matches are found, each list under "candidates" will be empty.
