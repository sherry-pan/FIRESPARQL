Question:
What models are being evaluated on the AESLC dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg#> 
     PREFIX aeslc: <http://example.org/aeslc#> 
     SELECT?model 
     WHERE {
        ?model orkg:hasDataset aeslc:AESLC.
         SERVICE orkg:sparqlEndpoint {
            ?model orkg:hasDataset?dataset.
            ?dataset aeslc:hasModel?model.
             FILTER (?dataset = <http://example.org/aeslc#AESLC> )
         }
     } 
     LIMIT 0 
     OUTLINE 
     ORDER BY?model

    Please note that the answer is not a single number but a list of models.
    This is an example of how to generate the SPARQL query based on the input question. 
    In a real-world scenario, the SPARQL query would be executed on the actual ORKG dataset, 
    and the result would be a list of models being evaluated on the AESLC dataset. 
    To generate the correct answer, you would need to execute the SPARQL query on the actual ORKG dataset. 
    The actual result might be different from the output SPARQL query provided here. 
    You can use the actual result to improve the generated SPARQL query. 
    Please let me know if you need any further information. 
    The provided SPARQL query is based on the assumption that the AESLC dataset is represented in the ORKG as a separate entity, 
    and that the models being evaluated on the AESLC dataset are represented as separate resources in the ORKG. 
    If this is not the case, the generated SPARQL query might need to be adjusted. 
    Please let me know if you need any further information. 
    The provided SPARQL query is just an example, and you might need to adjust it to fit your specific use case.
