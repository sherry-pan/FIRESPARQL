Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the EfficientNetV2-L model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT?s?p?o
WHERE {
 ?s a ora:Paper.
 ?s ora:has_code?o.
 ?o ora:has_benchmark?b.
 ?b ora:has_model?m.
 ?m ora:has_type "Model".
 ?m ora:label "EfficientNetV2-L".
 ?s ora:has_pred?p.
 ?p ora:has_uri "https://example.com/paper".
 ?p ora:has_label "Code Reference".
 ?b ora:has_pred?pred.
 ?pred ora:has_uri "https://example.com/validation".
 ?pred ora:has_label "Validation Research".
 ?b ora:has_pred?pred2.
 ?pred2 ora:has_uri "https://example.com/evaluation".
 ?pred2 ora:has_label "Evaluation".
}
```
    Please note that some predicates and URIs are placeholders and should be replaced with actual ones from the ORKG RDF data dump. The query is designed to find papers that have code references with EfficientNetV2-L model for benchmarking purposes. It uses the `ora:Paper`, `ora:has_code`, `ora:has_benchmark`, `ora:has_model`, `ora:has_type`, `ora:label`, `ora:has_pred`, and `ora:has_uri` predicates to query the RDF data. The query is designed to return the paper, code reference, benchmark, model, and type of the benchmark. 

    The actual SPARQL query might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG RDF data dump. The query assumes that the EfficientNetV2-L model is a type of model, and the benchmarking purposes are related to validation research and evaluation. The code references are linked to the papers through the `ora:has_code` predicate, and the benchmarking purposes are linked to the models through the `ora:has_model` predicate. 

    The query also assumes that the predicates and URIs used in the query are the ones that exist in the ORKG RDF data dump. The actual query might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the RDF data. 

    Please note that this is a simplified example and might not cover all possible cases. The actual query might need to be more complex to cover all possible scenarios. 

    Also, please note that the `ora:` prefix is used to qualify the predicates and URIs in the query. This prefix is used to distinguish the predicates and URIs used in the query from the actual predicates and URIs in the ORKG RDF data dump.
