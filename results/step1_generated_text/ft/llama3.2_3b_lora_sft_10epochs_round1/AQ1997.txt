Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Table-Sequence model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
        ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
                  rdfs:label  ?model_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "Table-Sequence")
        ?implementation        a                orkgc:Implementation.
        ?paper            orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
        ?dataset         orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
        ?implementation   orkgp:HASPaper           ?paper.
        ?code          rdfs:label              ?code_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?code_lbl) = "code")
