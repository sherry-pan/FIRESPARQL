Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of models tested on the SST-2 Binary classification benchmark dataset. 

First, I'll look through the context information. I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 has steps involving models like SVM and datasets like MNIST. There's also mention of CRF algorithms and SciBERT for relatedness. 

I notice that the context includes information about entities and properties. For instance, R283709 is a journal article with keywords like Named entity recognition and Graph analytics. R283710 lists authors and is related to entities like "method" and "solution proposal."

I need to extract relevant terms from the question. The key entities are "models" and "SST-2 Binary classification benchmark dataset." The property is "tested on." 

Looking at the context, I don't see any direct mention of SST-2, but there are mentions of other datasets like MNIST. However, the steps in R147652 describe a method involving models and datasets, which might be relevant. 

I'll consider the entities and properties from the context that relate to models and datasets. For example, R147652 is about a method involving models and datasets. R283709 and R283710 discuss methods and solutions that could be related to models.

Since the context doesn't have SST-2 specifically, I'll focus on the general terms related to models and datasets. I'll list the resources and predicates that match these terms, even if they aren't exact matches.

I'll structure the answer to include the extracted terms and their candidates, using the appropriate RDF prefixes. Each candidate will have a URI, label, and type. I'll make sure to include the correct types like orkgr for resources and orkgp for properties.

Finally, I'll format the JSON as specified, grouping the results under each extracted term and ensuring the structure is correct for further SPARQL processing.
