Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the QNLI benchmark dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "models" and "QNLI benchmark dataset." The property connecting them is "tested on." So, I'm looking for models that have been evaluated using the QNLI dataset.

Next, I'll look through the context information to find related entities and properties. From the context, I see mentions of models like SVM and possibly others, but the specific models tested on QNLI aren't directly listed. However, the context does talk about NER approaches and CRF algorithms, which might be relevant.

I also notice that the context includes information about papers and their venues, authors, and years, but that's probably not directly relevant to the models or datasets. The key is to focus on the parts that mention models and datasets.

Since the context doesn't explicitly list models tested on QNLI, I'll have to infer based on the information given. The steps mentioned in the context involve expanding seed terms, applying NER, and using CRF algorithms, which suggests that models like CRF or SVM might be part of the process.

I'll compute similarity scores for the extracted terms. "Models" would match with any model mentioned, and "QNLI benchmark dataset" would match with any dataset, though in the context, the datasets mentioned are MNIST and ACL Anthology, not QNLI. So, I might have to consider that the context doesn't have QNLI, but I can still list models that are similar or part of NER tasks.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and the top candidates, even if they're not exact matches. I'll make sure to use the correct RDF prefixes and include the necessary types and labels.
