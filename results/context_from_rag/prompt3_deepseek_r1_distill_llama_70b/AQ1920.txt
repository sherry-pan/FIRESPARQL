Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Provide a list of papers that have used the Funnel Transformer model and include the links to their code." 

First, I should break down the question to identify the key terms. The main entities here are "papers" and "Funnel Transformer model." The action is "have used," and the additional information needed is "links to their code."

Looking at the provided context, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there are papers like R147246 and R283710, each with authors and publication details. The context also mentions methods, datasets, and entities related to NER and other models.

I need to find which of these papers are connected to the Funnel Transformer. However, scanning through the context, I don't see any direct mention of "Funnel Transformer." The models mentioned are SVM and possibly others in the steps, but not the specific one in the question.

Since the context doesn't include the Funnel Transformer, I can't extract any relevant papers from it. Therefore, the candidates list would be empty because there's no matching information in the provided data.

I should structure the JSON response to reflect this, showing that no relevant papers were found based on the given context.

```json
{
  "question": "Provide a list of papers that have used the Funnel Transformer model and include the links to their code?",
  "extracted_terms": {
    "papers": [],
    "Funnel Transformer model": [],
    "used": [],
    "links to their code": []
  },
  "candidates": {
    "papers": [],
    "Funnel Transformer model": [],
    "used": [],
    "links to their code": []
  }
}
```
