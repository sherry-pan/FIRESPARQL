Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question "List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the ART/CoreSC benchmark dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "metrics" and "ART/CoreSC benchmark dataset". The property mentioned is "used to evaluate". So, I'm looking for metrics related to evaluating models on this specific dataset.

Looking at the context, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there's a resource R147652 which has steps involving evaluation using a CRF algorithm. There's also R147244 with a value of "93.9", which might be a metric like accuracy. Then, R283709 and R283710 describe papers with various methods and keywords, including "Named entity recognition" and "Graph analytics", which could relate to evaluation metrics.

I need to find entities and properties similar to "metrics", "ART/CoreSC benchmark dataset", and "used to evaluate". From the data, I can see that R147652 is about evaluation steps, R147244 has a metric value, and R283709 and R283710 discuss methods and solutions that might involve evaluation metrics.

So, I'll group the candidates under each extracted term. For "metrics", I'll include resources related to evaluation steps and metric values. For "ART/CoreSC benchmark dataset", since it's not explicitly mentioned, I'll look for similar datasets or benchmarks. For "used to evaluate", I'll include predicates related to evaluation and methods.

I'll structure the JSON output with these groupings, ensuring each candidate has the correct URI, label, and type. I'll use the appropriate RDF prefixes and include the necessary types like "orkgc:Resource" and "orkgp:Predicate".

Finally, I'll make sure the JSON is correctly formatted, with each term having up to five candidates, and include the necessary details for each candidate.
