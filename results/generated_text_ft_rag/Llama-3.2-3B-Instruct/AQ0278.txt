Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the Atari 2600 Battle Zone dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Battle Zone")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                  orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?eval,
                orkgpHAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?contribution orkgp:P31               ?paper,
                rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?model_lbl)
```    Note that this query will not return any results. The reason is that the dataset label "Atari 2600 Battle Zone" is not present in the provided context. The query is designed to find models evaluated on this specific dataset, but since the dataset is not present in the context, the query will not return any results. 

However, the query can be modified to return a different result. For example, if we assume that the model names are stored in the "model" property of the evaluation, we can modify the query as follows:

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Battle Zone")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                  orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?eval,
                orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?contribution orkgp:P31               ?paper,
                rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?model_lbl)
```

This query will return all the model names that have been evaluated on the Atari 2600 Battle Zone dataset. The model names are stored in the "model" property of the evaluation, and the query uses the `orkgp:HAS_DATASET` property to filter the evaluations to those that have been performed on the specified dataset. 

However, this query will still not return any results because the dataset label "Atari 2600 Battle Zone" is not present in the provided context. 

To make the query return results, the dataset label "Atari 2600 Battle Zone" should be present in the provided context. 

Here is an example of how the context could be modified to include the dataset label:

```json
{
  "context": "Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the Atari 2600 Battle Zone dataset?"
}
```

With this modification, the query will return the model names that have been evaluated on the Atari 2600 Battle Zone dataset. 

Here is the modified query:

```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Battle Zone")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                  orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?eval,
                orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?contribution orkgp:P31               ?paper,
                rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?model_lbl)
```<|eot_id|>
