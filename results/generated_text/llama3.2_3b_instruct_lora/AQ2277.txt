Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the T-ConvS2S model?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?model        a            orkgc:Model;
                   rdfs:label      ?model_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "T-ConvS2S")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                       orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
      }     ```
    Please note that the actual answer may be multiple values. The above code snippet only returns one value. You may need to modify it to return multiple values. To return multiple values, you would need to add a `?code?code2` line in the query and `?cont?cont2` line in the query and so on. This is because the `?cont` line is not a single value but a list of values. You may also need to add `?cont?cont3` line, and so on, depending on the actual number of values in the list. 

    Please note that the `?cont` line is not a single value but a list of values. You may also need to add `?cont?cont2` line, and so on, depending on the actual number of values in the list. 

    Also note that the above SPARQL query assumes that the dataset used for benchmarking the T-ConvS2S model is the same for all the papers. If this is not the case, the query would need to be modified to account for this.
