Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PEGASUS model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
     ?papers rdfs:label?title.
      FILTER(REGEX(?title, "PEGASUS"))
     ?papers orkgp:P31?cont.
     ?cont orkgp:P3756?code.
     }<|eot_id|>
