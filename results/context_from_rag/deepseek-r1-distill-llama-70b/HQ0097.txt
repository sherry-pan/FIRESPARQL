Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to answer the question "What types of nanocarriers do have therapeutic effect?" using the provided JSON properties. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's about identifying different types of nanocarriers that have a therapeutic effect. So, I'm looking for properties related to types, categories, or classifications of nanocarriers, especially those linked to their therapeutic effects.

Looking at the JSON data, I see a list of properties with their labels. I'll go through each one to see which might be relevant.

1. **AFFECTS**: This seems related to cause and effect. If a nanocarrier affects something, it might be therapeutic. So, this could link nanocarriers to their effects.

2. **CAUSES**: Similar to AFFECTS, this could show the causal relationship between nanocarriers and their therapeutic outcomes.

3. **COEXISTS_WITH**: This might indicate what nanocarriers are used alongside, possibly in therapeutic contexts.

4. **COMPARED_WITH**: While useful for comparisons, it might not directly show therapeutic effects but could help in understanding different types.

5. **CSVW_*** properties like cells, columns, etc., seem more about data structure, not directly relevant here.

6. **DATA**, **HAS_BENCHMARK**, **HAS_DATASET**, etc., are more about data handling, not the therapeutic aspect.

7. **HAS_APPROACH**: This could relate to methods or strategies, possibly including therapeutic approaches using nanocarriers.

8. **HAS_METHOD**: This is about the methods used, which might include therapeutic methods involving nanocarriers.

9. **HAS_MESH**: Not sure what MESH refers to here, maybe a type of nanocarrier structure?

10. **HAS_EVALUATION**, **HAS_IMPLEMENTATION**: These are more about assessment and execution, not directly about types.

So, focusing on the properties that relate to effects, causation, coexistence, and methods. The most relevant seem to be AFFECTS, CAUSES, COEXISTS_WITH, COMPARED_WITH, HAS_APPROACH, and HAS_METHOD. Each of these can help link nanocarriers to their therapeutic effects or categorize them based on their functionality.

The question asks about the types of nanocarriers with therapeutic effects. Relevant properties from the JSON that can help answer this are those related to effects, causation, coexistence, comparison, and methods. These properties link nanocarriers to their therapeutic outcomes or categorize them by functionality.
