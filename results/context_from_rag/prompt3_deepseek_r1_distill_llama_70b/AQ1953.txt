Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user's question is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the CL-Titles-Parser model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "papers" and "CL-Titles-Parser model". The action mentioned is "utilized", which implies a relationship between the papers and the model.

Looking at the context data, I see that there are several resources related to papers, such as R147246 and R283710, which have properties like P27 (authors) and P29 (year). These resources are connected via predicates like P31 (is a) and HAS_VENUE. 

I also notice that the context includes information about methods and models, like the steps for NER approaches and keyphrase extraction. However, there's no direct mention of the CL-Titles-Parser model in the provided data. This means I might not find exact matches, but I can look for similar entities or related concepts.

Next, I'll need to find similar entities or properties. Since the CL-Titles-Parser isn't present, I'll look for other models or methods mentioned. For example, the context talks about using SciBERT for semantic relatedness and CRF algorithms for NER. These could be related to the CL-Titles-Parser, which is also a tool used in NLP tasks.

I'll also check for papers that have used similar models or tools. The resources R147246 and R283710 are both papers with authors and publication details. They might be relevant even if they don't specifically mention the CL-Titles-Parser.

Now, I'll structure the JSON output as per the example. I'll group the results by the extracted terms: "papers" and "CL-Titles-Parser model". For each term, I'll list the top candidates from the context data.

Since there's no exact match for the CL-Titles-Parser, I'll include the closest related resources, such as the papers that used similar models or methods. I'll also note that the CL-Titles-Parser isn't found but suggest related models.

Finally, I'll ensure that the URIs use the correct prefixes and that each candidate includes the necessary details like URI, label, and type. I'll also make sure the JSON structure is correct for further processing into SPARQL queries.
