 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_id?title
    WHERE {
     ?benchmark       orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                        orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
     ?paper         orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
     ?paper         orkgp:ID                 ?paper_id.
     ?paper         rdfs:label              ?title.
      FILTER (str(?benchmark_lbl) = "Gibson PointGoal Navigation")
    }<|eot_id|>
