Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Concept Mention Extraction model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper    a            orkgc:Paper;
                rdfs:label   ?paper_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?paper_lbl) = "papers with the following code: Concept Mention Extraction")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
      ?dataset       orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE     ?code.
      ?code         orkgp:P31               ?model.
      ?model        rdfs:label               ?model_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "Concept Mention Extraction")
     }<|eot_id|>
