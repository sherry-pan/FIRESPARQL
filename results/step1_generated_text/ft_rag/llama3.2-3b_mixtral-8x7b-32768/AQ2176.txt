Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PAR Transformer Large model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?code_ref
WHERE {
  orkgp:HAS_CODE_REFERENCE?code_ref.
 ?code_ref orkgp:P31?paper.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?cont.
 ?cont orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?bench.
 ?bench rdfs:label?label.
  FILTER(REGEX(?label, "PAR Transformer Large"))
}
``` 
    The final answer to the question "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PAR Transformer Large model for benchmarking purposes?" is given by the SPARQL query:
```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?code_ref
WHERE {
  orkgp:HAS_CODE_REFERENCE?code_ref.
 ?code_ref orkgp:P31?paper.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?cont.
 ?cont orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?bench.
 ?bench rdfs:label?label.
  FILTER(REGEX(?label, "PAR Transformer Large"))
}
``` 
    Note that the answer may contain empty strings if there are no papers that have used the specified model for benchmarking purposes. 

    This problem requires you to apply the SPARQL query to the provided context. You can use the SPARQL query in your application to retrieve the code references in papers that have used the PAR Transformer Large model for benchmarking purposes. 

    To apply the SPARQL query, you need to use a SPARQL query engine like Apache Jena or SPARQLlib. You can then execute the query using the query engine and retrieve the results. 

    Please note that the actual output of the query may contain more or less data than the provided answer. The answer is provided based on the context and the SPARQL query.

    Note: The answer is given based on the provided context and the SPARQL query. The actual output of the query may vary depending on the data in the ORKG. 

    To get the actual output of the query, you need to execute the SPARQL query using a SPARQL query engine. The output of the query will contain the code references in papers that have used the PAR Transformer Large model for benchmarking purposes. 

    You can use the following code in Python using the Apache Jena library to execute the SPARQL query:
``` 
    ```python
from SPARQLWrapper import SPARQLWrapper, JSON
sparql = SPARQLWrapper("http://localhost:8080/sparql")
sparql.setQuery("SELECT DISTINCT?code_ref")
sparql.setReturnFormat(JSON)
results = sparql.query()
print(results.read())
``` 
    ```
    The output of the code will contain the code references in papers that
