Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the NCBI-disease dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
    WHERE {
     ?benchmark        a                orkgp:Benchmark;
                        rdfs:label      ?benchmark_lbl.
      FILTER (str(?benchmark_lbl) = "NCBI-disease")
     ?model          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
     ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?model;
