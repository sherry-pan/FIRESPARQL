Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the Reuters-21578 benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a            orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label   ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Reuters-21578")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                       orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
      ?paper         orkgp:P31              ?benchmark.
      ?contrib       orkgp:P31              ?paper.
      ?model        rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
      ?model        orkgp:P32               ?contrib.
     } ORDER BY DESC(?model_lbl) LIMIT 5
```    Note that the SPARQL query provided is based on the provided context and may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG RDF data. Also, note that the scores assigned to the resources are subjective and based on the context provided. The actual scores may vary depending on the specific requirements of the query.<|eot_id|>
