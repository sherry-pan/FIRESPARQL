Okay, so I need to figure out the most common location mentioned in the studies based on the provided ORKG RDF data. Let me start by understanding the context information given.

Looking at the context, I see several triples that might be relevant. There are entries about resources, predicates, and their values. For example, I notice that there are resources like R147246 and R283710, which have properties like HAS_VENUE and P27, which seems to denote authors.

Wait, the question is about the most common location. So I should look for information related to locations, probably where studies were conducted or where the authors are from. In the context, I see that R147246 has a HAS_VENUE pointing to R147247, but I don't see the actual value of R147247. Similarly, R283710 has HAS_VENUE pointing to R283711, again without the value provided.

I also see that R147244 has a HAS_VALUE of "93.9", but I'm not sure how that relates to location. Maybe it's a score or some metric, but not directly a location.

Looking further, the P27 predicate seems to list authors. For R147246, the authors are "Ligia Sierra", "Betty L López", "Flavio Forni", "Maria Angela Vandelli", "Michele Zoli", and "Antonietta Vilella". For R283710, the authors are "Yuanyuan Wu", "Mengxing Huang", "Zhaocheng Tu", and "Siling Feng". 

If I'm looking for locations, maybe the authors' affiliations can hint at the locations. But without explicit affiliation data, it's hard to determine. Alternatively, the venues where the studies were published might indicate the location, but again, the venue URIs don't have explicit values here.

Wait, maybe the P29 predicate indicates the year, and P28 might be the volume or issue. But that doesn't help with location either.

I also see that R283709 has a P97005 value of "method" and P97004 as "solution proposal". It's part of the "scholarly domain" and involves "Graph analytics", "Horizon 2020", etc. Horizon 2020 is a European Union research program, so maybe the location is Europe or specific European countries.

But without explicit location data, it's challenging. Perhaps the most common location is inferred from the authors' nationalities or the funding source. Since Horizon 2020 is EU-based, maybe the studies are commonly conducted in EU countries.

Alternatively, looking at the authors' names, some like "Ligia Sierra" and "Betty L López" might suggest Spanish or Latin American origins, while others like "Yuanyuan Wu" and "Mengxing Huang" are likely Chinese. So maybe the most common locations are China and Spain, but this is speculative.

Given the data provided, I don't see explicit location information. Therefore, I might have to make an educated guess based on the context clues. Since Horizon 2020 is mentioned, which is an EU program, the most common location could be European countries, perhaps Spain, given the authors' names.

But I'm not entirely sure. The data doesn't explicitly state locations, so my answer might not be accurate. I'll have to go with the information I can infer from the authors and funding sources.

To determine the most common location in the studies based on the provided context, I analyzed the available data. The context includes information about authors and funding sources, such as Horizon 2020, which is a European Union research program. Additionally, some authors' names suggest possible affiliations with specific countries. 

Given the mention of Horizon 2020, which is associated with European research initiatives, and considering the diversity of authors' names that may hint at various nationalities, the most common location could be inferred as European countries, particularly those involved in Horizon 2020 projects. However, without explicit location data, this remains speculative.

Answer: The most common location in the studies appears to be associated with European countries, likely due to the involvement in Horizon 2020, a European Union research program.
