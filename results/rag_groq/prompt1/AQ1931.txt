Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The user is asking for a list of papers that used the Switch Transformer model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of papers. I see several resources labeled as "Paper" such as R211524, R211922, R211327, and others. Each of these has a label, like "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire" or "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)". 

Next, I need to check if any of these papers mention the Switch Transformer model. However, looking through the context, I don't see any explicit mention of "Switch Transformer" in the labels or descriptions. 

Since the context doesn't provide information about the Switch Transformer model or code links, I can't retrieve any relevant papers from the given data. Therefore, the result is an empty list.

The context provided does not contain any information related to the Switch Transformer model or links to code. Therefore, no relevant papers can be retrieved from the given data.
