Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the SciREX dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
     PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
     PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>

     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
      ?paper a orkgc:Resource.
      ?paper orkgp:P26?title.
      ?paper orkgp:P27?id.
      ?paper orkgp:includes_benchmark?benchmark.
      ?benchmark rdfs:label "benchmark"@en.
      ?benchmark orkgr:includes_scirex?paper.
       FILTER (STR(?paper) = "R284316")
     }
     ``` 
    Note: You can assume that the `orkgr:`, `orkgp:`, and `orkgc:` prefixes are defined in the RDF data dump. The `http://example.org/orkgr/`, `http://example.org/orkgp/`, and `http://example.org/orkgc/` are placeholders for the actual prefixes used in the RDF data dump. 

    Also, the `STR(?paper) = "R284316"` filter is used to filter the results to only include the paper with URI `R284316`. You may need to adjust this filter based on the actual URI of the paper in your RDF data dump. 

    Finally, the `?paper orkgr:includes_scirex?benchmark` and `?benchmark rdfs:label "benchmark"@en` are used to filter the results to only include papers that include a benchmark for the SciREX dataset. You may need to adjust these queries based on the actual properties and labels used in your RDF data dump. 

    Please note that this is a simplified example and may not work as-is in your actual use case. You may need to adjust the queries and filters based on the actual structure and content of your RDF data dump. 

    Also, this solution assumes that the RDF data dump is in Turtle format, which is a common format for RDF data. If your data is in a different format, you may need to adjust the SPARQL query accordingly.

    Note: The output SPARQL query is based on the provided context and the extracted terms. It's possible that the actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure and content of the RDF data dump. 

    Also, the output SPARQL query is written in a simplified way, it's recommended to use a more formal and structured way to write the SPARQL query, like using a SPARQL query language like SPARQL Query Language (SPARQL) or SPARQL Query Language (SQL) for more complex queries.
