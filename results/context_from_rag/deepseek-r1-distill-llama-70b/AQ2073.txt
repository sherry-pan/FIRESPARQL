Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question about finding code references in papers that used the BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo model for benchmarking. 

First, the question is asking about code references in papers, so I'm looking for properties related to code, implementations, or benchmarks. 

Looking through the JSON, I see properties like "HAS_BENCHMARK" and "HAS_IMPLEMENTATION". These seem directly related because benchmarks are used for evaluation, and implementations would involve code. 

There's also "evaluation" which could relate to how the model was tested, and "method" which might describe the approach used in the paper. 

Additionally, "has dataset" could be relevant because datasets are often used in benchmarking. 

I should list these properties with explanations of why they fit the question.

The most relevant properties from the JSON file that could help answer the question about finding code references in papers using the BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo model for benchmarking are:

```json
[
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_BENCHMARK",
    "label": "has benchmark",
    "reason": "This property is relevant because it relates to benchmarking purposes, which is a key aspect of the question."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_IMPLEMENTATION",
    "label": "implementation",
    "reason": "This property is relevant because it refers to the implementation details, which could include code references."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_EVALUATION",
    "label": "evaluation",
    "reason": "This property is relevant because it relates to the evaluation process, which often includes benchmarking and could involve code references."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_METHOD",
    "label": "method",
    "reason": "This property is relevant because it refers to the method used, which in this case is the BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo model."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_DATASET",
    "label": "has dataset",
    "reason": "This property is relevant because datasets are often used in benchmarking and could be related to code references."
  }
]
```
