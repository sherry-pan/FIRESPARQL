Question:
List the code links in papers that use the H-NLI model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
    PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc/>

    SELECT?p?o
    WHERE {
     ?p a orkp:Predicate.
     ?p orkp:type orkp:Property.
     ?o a orkc:Resource.
      FILTER (strstarts(STR(?o), 'http://dx.doi.org/'))
      |?
     ?o a orkc:Resource.
     ?o orkp:label?l.
      FILTER (strstarts(STR(?l), 'H-NLI model') OR strstarts(STR(?l), 'SVM') OR strstarts(STR(?l), 'MNIST'))
      |?
     ?o orkp:label?l.
     ?o orkp:property?p.
      FILTER (strstarts(STR(?p), 'use'))
      }

    Note: The provided RDF data dump is not included in this response as it is not relevant to the task. The SPARQL query is designed to work with the provided context and RDF data dump. 

    This SPARQL query is designed to answer the question "List the code links in papers that use the H-NLI model in any benchmark?" by filtering resources that match the specified criteria. It uses the `strstarts` function to check for the presence of specific strings in the labels and properties of the resources. The query is designed to work with the provided context and RDF data dump. 

    Please note that the actual RDF data dump and the `example.org` prefixes are not provided as they are not relevant to the task. The query is designed to work with the provided context and RDF data dump. 

    The query can be executed against a SPARQL endpoint or a local RDF store to retrieve the desired results. 

    The output of the query will be a list of resources that match the specified criteria, along with their labels and properties. The resources are expected to be in the format of `http://example.org/resource/` or `http://example.org/resource#`. 

    The query can be optimized and fine-tuned to improve its performance and accuracy.
