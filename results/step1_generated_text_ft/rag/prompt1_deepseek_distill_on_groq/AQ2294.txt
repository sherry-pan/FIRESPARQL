Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The query is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the Duel HS model and include links to their code. 

First, I should look through the context data to find any mentions of the Duel HS model. The context is in the form of RDF triples, so I'll need to parse through each line to see if any of the resources are related to the Duel HS model or papers that use it.

Looking at the first file, I see several resources labeled as papers, such as R211524, R211922, R211327, etc. Each of these has a label, like "NNE: A set for Nested Named Entity Recognition..." and others. None of these labels mention the Duel HS model, so maybe the Duel HS model isn't directly referenced here.

Next, I check the second file. Here, I see resources like R76234 labeled "BabelEnconding," R76243 talking about measuring similarity using cosine similarity, and R76244 labeled "Team 2 Subtask 1 English." Again, none of these seem to relate to the Duel HS model.

I also notice that some resources are of type 'Contribution' or 'Comparison,' but their labels don't indicate any connection to the Duel HS model. There's a resource R75840 about factors influencing decision-making, but that's not relevant either.

Since none of the provided context mentions the Duel HS model or any papers using it, I can conclude that there's no relevant information available in the given data dump. Therefore, the top 5 similar entities or properties can't be retrieved because they don't exist in the context provided.

The provided context does not contain any information related to the "Duel HS model" or papers that utilize it. Therefore, there are no relevant entities or properties to retrieve.
