Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the 6-layer QRNN model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

    SELECT?uri 
    WHERE {
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?paperRef.
     ?paper orkgr:has_model?model.
      FILTER (?model = <http://example.org/orkgr/R147246>).
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?codeRef.
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmarkRef.
      FILTER (?benchmarkRef = <http://example.org/orkgp/BENCHMARKING_PURPOSES>).
      BIND(strips(?paper,?codeRef,?benchmarkRef)) AS?uri.
    }
    ```sparql

    ORKG entities/properties URIs used in the query:
    orkgr:R147246
    orkgp:HAS_PAPER
    orkgp:HAS_CODE
    orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK
    orkgp:BENCHMARKING_PURPOSES

    Note that the actual URIs used in the query are placeholders and should be replaced with the correct URIs from the ORKG.
    The provided URIs are for demonstration purposes only.
    To generate the correct SPARQL query, one would need to replace these placeholders with the actual URIs from the ORKG. 
    The actual URIs should be obtained by looking up the entities and properties mentioned in the question in the provided context. 
    The correct URIs can then be used to construct the SPARQL query. 
    The generated SPARQL query should be able to query the ORKG and retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 
    The answer to the input question is the URI of the papers that have used the 6-layer QRNN model for benchmarking purposes. 
    The answer can be obtained by executing the generated SPARQL query on the ORKG. 
    The output of the SPARQL query will be a list of URIs of the papers that match the query conditions. 
    The actual URIs in the output will depend on the actual URIs used in the query and the structure of the ORKG. 
    The output can be further processed to extract the relevant information from the papers. 
    The processed output can then be used to answer the input question. 
    The answer to the input question can be a list of URIs, a string, or any other data type that can be extracted from the ORKG. 
    The actual answer will depend on the structure of the ORKG and the query conditions. 
    The output of the SPARQL query can be used to retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 
    The correct answer can be obtained by executing the
