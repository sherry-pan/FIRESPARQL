Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the WOS-46985 dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "research papers" and "WOS-46985 dataset". The action is "performed benchmarks on". 

Looking at the context, I see two main resources: R147246 and R284317. Both seem to be papers with various properties. R147246 has authors like Ligia Sierra and others, published in 2015, volume 6. R284317 is from 2021, volume 11, with authors Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta, and a DOI link.

Next, I need to compute similarity. Since the question is about benchmarks on the WOS-46985 dataset, I look for papers that mention this dataset. However, in the provided data, I don't see any direct mention of WOS-46985. But I can infer that both papers might have used certain datasets based on their titles and content.

R147246's title isn't provided, but R284316's abstract discusses entity knowledge extraction and mentions datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP. Since WOS-46985 isn't mentioned, I'll consider these as related datasets and compute similarity based on that.

For each extracted term, I'll find the top 5 candidates. "Research papers" would match the two resources, R147246 and R284317. "WOS-46985 dataset" doesn't have a direct match, so I'll look for similar datasets mentioned, like AIDA and MEANTIME. "Performed benchmarks on" relates to properties like P5044 (Journal Article) and P37015 (evaluation method).

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their candidates, ensuring the correct RDF prefixes and types are used. Each candidate will have a URI, label, score, type, and RDF type.

I need to make sure the similarity scores are reasonable, even if the exact dataset isn't present. I'll assign higher scores to the papers since they are directly related to research, and slightly lower scores to the datasets as they are related but not exact matches.

Finally, I'll format everything into the required JSON structure, grouping the results by each extracted term and listing their top candidates.
