Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the m that are used to evaluate models on the SQuAD1.1 dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by understanding the question. The user is asking for the metrics used to evaluate models on the SQuAD1.1 dataset. So, the key terms here are "metrics," "models," and "SQuAD1.1 dataset." 

Looking at the context data, I see several resources and predicates. The first part of the context describes a process involving seed terms like SVM and MNIST, expanding them using SciBERT, and applying NER with CRF. There's also a section about a paper analyzing funded projects and using graph analytics, keyphrase extraction, and named entity recognition.

I need to extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities are "SQuAD1.1 dataset" and "models," and the property is "evaluated on" or "used to evaluate." 

Next, I'll look through the RDF data to find similar entities and properties. The context mentions resources like R147244 with a value of 93.9, which might be a metric. There are also resources related to papers and their venues, authors, and years. 

I notice that R283709 is about a journal article with keywords like "Graph analytics," "Horizon 2020," "Keyphrase extraction," etc. It also mentions "entity extraction" and "Natural language processing," which might relate to NER models. 

Looking for metrics, I see that R147244 has a value of 93.9, which could be an accuracy score or F1-score. There's also R147246, which has multiple authors, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

For the SQuAD1.1 dataset, I don't see it explicitly mentioned in the context. However, there's a mention of "MPQA benchmark dataset" in the example, which might be similar. So, I can infer that the SQuAD dataset would be treated similarly as a benchmark.

Now, I'll try to find the top 5 most similar entities or properties. Since SQuAD isn't in the data, I'll look for related datasets or benchmarks. R147244 with the value 93.9 could be a metric like accuracy. R283709's properties might include metrics used in their study.

I'll also consider the properties used in the context. P39020 describes steps, P31 links to resources, HAS_VENUE, P29 for year, P28 for issue, and P27 for authors. These might not directly relate to metrics but could be part of the evaluation process.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and the top candidates. Since SQuAD isn't present, I'll use the closest related resources and properties, ensuring I include the correct RDF prefixes and entity types.

I need to make sure the JSON includes the question, extracted terms, and the top 5 candidates for each term. For "SQuAD1.1 dataset," I'll use the closest benchmark resources. For "models," I'll look for any model-related resources. For "evaluated on," I'll include the relevant properties like HAS_EVALUATION.

I think I've covered all the necessary steps, even though the exact dataset isn't in the context. I'll proceed to format the answer accordingly.
