Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question: "What models are being evaluated on the FTD dataset?" 

First, I'll break down the question. It's asking about models being evaluated on a specific dataset, so I'm looking for properties related to evaluation, models, and datasets.

Looking through the JSON, I see properties like "evaluation" (HAS_EVALUATION), which seems directly related because it's about assessing models. Then there's "method" (HAS_METHOD), which could refer to the models or approaches being used. "Has dataset" (HAS_DATASET) is also relevant because it ties the evaluation to a specific dataset. 

I should also consider if there are other properties that might indirectly relate, but these three seem the most straightforward. They cover the evaluation aspect, the models/methods, and the dataset connection. So, I'll list these with brief explanations of why each fits.

  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_EVALUATION",
    "label": "evaluation",
    "reason": "This property is relevant because it directly relates to the evaluation of models, which is what the question is asking about."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_METHOD",
    "label": "method",
    "reason": "This property is relevant because it refers to the methods or models being used, which are the subject of the evaluation."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_DATASET",
    "label": "has dataset",
    "reason": "This property is relevant because it specifies the dataset being used for evaluation, which is the FTD dataset in this case."
  }
