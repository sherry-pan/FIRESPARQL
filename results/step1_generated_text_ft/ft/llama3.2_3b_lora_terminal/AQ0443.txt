Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the UCF101 (finetuned) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "UCF101 (finetuned)")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
      ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                      rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
     } 
    IF you want to get the full query with some explanations, please let me know.
    If you want to generate a new query for a different question, just let me know the question and I'll be happy to help. 

    Here is the explanation for the above query.
    The query works as follows:
    1. We start by selecting all papers and their labels.
    2. We filter the dataset labels to only include UCF101 (finetuned).
    3. We then select all benchmarks and their corresponding datasets.
    4. We then select all papers and their corresponding benchmarks.
    5. Finally, we select the papers and their labels.

    The query uses the following predicates:
    - orkgp:HAS_DATASET       : The has dataset predicate.
    - orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK      : The has benchmark predicate.
    - orkgp:P31                : The P31 predicate for the paper-rdf1 equivalence.
    - rdfs:label                : The label predicate for the dataset and paper.
    - a                    : The type predicate for the dataset.
    
    The query uses the following filters:
    - str(?dataset_lbl) = "UCF101 (finetuned)" : A filter to only include datasets labeled with "UCF101 (finetuned)".
    - str(?paper_lbl) =?paper_lbl : A filter to only include papers with the same label as the paper.
    
    The query uses the following joins:
    -?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
    -?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
    -?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
    -?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                      rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
    The query uses the following constants:
    - None. 

    The query has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the number of papers. 

    The query has a space complexity of O(n) where n is the number of papers. 

    The query assumes that the data is stored in a graph and that the graph is finite. 

    The query assumes that the data is stored in a RDF file and that the RDF file is in a standard format. 

    The query does not assume any specific database or data storage system.
