Alright, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the SNLI dataset, including their titles and IDs. 

First, I'll look through the context information. The context includes data from an ORKG RDF dump, which contains information about various resources, predicates, and their values. 

Looking at the context, I see two main resources: R147652 and R284316, along with R147246 and R284317. 

Starting with R147652, it describes a research method with five steps. It mentions using seed terms like SVM and MNIST, expanding with TSE using SciBERT, annotating training data, applying a CRF algorithm, and filtering entity candidates. This seems related to NER (Named Entity Recognition) and might be connected to datasets, but I don't see a direct mention of SNLI here.

Next, R147246 has several predicates, including P27 which lists authors like Ligia Sierra, Betty L LÃ³pez, Flavio Forni, Maria Angela Vandelli, Michele Zoli, and Antonietta Vilella. It also mentions the year 2015 and a value of "6" under P28. This seems to be a paper or publication with multiple authors, but again, no direct link to SNLI.

Moving on to R284316, the description is about extracting entity knowledge from text using a model called jpark. It mentions using tools like Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL. The datasets used for evaluation are AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP. This paper is about improving NLP tasks but doesn't mention SNLI.

R284317 provides more details about this paper, including the authors Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta, published in 2021, and a DOI link. The title isn't explicitly mentioned, but the abstract discusses entity recognition and linking, which is relevant to NLP tasks but not specifically SNLI.

Since the context doesn't mention the SNLI dataset or any papers that benchmark on it, I can't extract any relevant information. Therefore, the candidates list for both "research papers" and "SNLI dataset" will be empty.
