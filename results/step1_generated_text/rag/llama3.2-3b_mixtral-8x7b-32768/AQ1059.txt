Question:
What is the top benchmark score and its metric on the MAZEA dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?benchmarkScore?metric
WHERE {
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasBenchmarkScore?benchmarkScore.
 ?benchmarkScore ora:hasMetric?metric.
}
``` 
    Note: You are not allowed to assume any additional information or context not provided in the input. 

    Also, note that the provided SPARQL query is already generated based on the provided input question and context. The task is to verify the correctness of this generated query. 

    You can use the provided query as a reference to verify its correctness. 

    Please make sure to use the correct SPARQL syntax and semantics as specified in the W3C SPARQL standard. 

    The task is to verify the correctness of the generated query, not to generate a new query. 

    You can use the provided context to verify the correctness of the query by checking if it correctly links the entities and properties mentioned in the question to the correct entities and properties in the ORKG. 

    Please respond with either "Correct" if the generated query is correct or "Incorrect" if the generated query is incorrect. 

    Do not provide any additional explanations or justifications. 

    Do not provide any new information or context not provided in the input. 

    Respond with either "Correct" or "Incorrect". 

    I will use the response to determine the final answer.
