Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the Classical music, 5 seconds at 12 kHz dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://orkgr.org/ontology/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://orkgc.org/ontology/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkgp.org/ontology/>
    SELECT?m { 
   ?m orkgp:HAS_MODEL?m1.
    FILTER (?m1 orkgp:HAS_DATASET orkgr:R122689 )
    }
    ```



## Step 1: Determine the entities and properties mentioned in the question
The entities and properties mentioned in the question are:
- Classical music, 5 seconds at 12 kHz dataset
- models
- evaluated on

## Step 2: Identify the candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question
From the provided context, the following candidate entities and properties can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question:
- Classical music, 5 seconds at 12 kHz dataset: orkgr:R122689
- models: orkgp:HAS_MODEL
- evaluated on: orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query
To list the models that have been evaluated on the Classical music, 5 seconds at 12 kHz dataset, the SPARQL query should filter for models that have a model or have the dataset with URI orkgr:R122689.

```sparql
SELECT?m { 
?m orkgp:HAS_MODEL?m1.
FILTER (?m1 orkgp:HAS_DATASET orkgr:R122689 )
}
```

The final answer is: ```sparql
SELECT?m { 
?m orkgp:HAS_MODEL?m1.
FILTER (?m1 orkgp:HAS_DATASET orkgr:R122689 )
}
```<|eot_id|>
