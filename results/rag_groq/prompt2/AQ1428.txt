Alright, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What is the best performing model benchmarking the WMT2016 German-English dataset in terms of BLEU score metric?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The key entities here are "WMT2016 German-English dataset" and "BLEU score metric." The property involved is "benchmarking" or "evaluated on."

Looking at the context, I see that there are two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a method involving steps for entity recognition, which doesn't seem directly related to the question. R284316, on the other hand, is a journal article about extracting entity knowledge using various tools and datasets, but it doesn't mention the WMT dataset or BLEU scores.

Since the provided data doesn't have information about the WMT2016 dataset or BLEU scores, I can't find any direct matches. However, I can infer that the user is looking for models evaluated on a specific dataset with a particular metric.

So, I'll structure the answer by extracting the terms and then note that there are no candidates found in the provided data. This way, the user knows that the information isn't available in the current context.
