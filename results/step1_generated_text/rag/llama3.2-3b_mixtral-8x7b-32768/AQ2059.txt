Question:
List the code links in papers that use the DrQA model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://orkp.org/orkp/>

    SELECT?p?c
    WHERE {
       ?c orkg:has_contribution?contribution.
       ?contribution orkp:has_benchmark?benchmark.
       ?contribution orkp:has_code_link?code_link.
       ?contribution orkg:has_label "DrQA model".
       ?benchmark orkp:has_label "benchmark".
       ?code_link a orkp:CodeLink.
        FILTER (STRLIKE(?c, "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36054") OR STRLIKE(?c, "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36053"))
        }
    ```
```
    Note: This answer is based on the provided template and the given context. The generated SPARQL query is a direct output of the provided template and the given context. 

    The generated SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question. It uses the entities and properties mentioned in the question and the provided context to generate the query. 

    The query first filters the contributions based on the presence of the DrQA model label, then filters the benchmark based on the presence of the benchmark label, and finally filters the code links based on the presence of the code link predicate and the specific URIs provided in the context. The filter condition is designed to retrieve the code links in papers that use the DrQA model in any benchmark. 

    Please note that the generated SPARQL query is based on the provided template and the given context, and it may need to be modified or extended to accommodate additional requirements or complexities. 

    If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, please don't hesitate to ask.
