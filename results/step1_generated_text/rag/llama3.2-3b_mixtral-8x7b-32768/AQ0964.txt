    Note: The answer is provided as a string. Do not attempt to execute this query. 

    The query is generated based on the provided context and the input question. It uses the entities and properties mentioned in the question to query the ORKG. The query retrieves the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the specified dataset. 

    The query first filters the dataset with a label of "Atari 2600 Battle Zone Benchmark" and then retrieves the metrics associated with this dataset. It further filters the metrics to only include those with a label of "AUC-PR" and "F1-Macro". The query then binds the concatenated labels of the dataset and metric as the answer. 

    The query assumes that the entities and properties mentioned in the question are correctly linked to the ORKG and that the query is executed on the ORKG. 

    The answer is "AUC-PR F1-Macro". 

    Please note that the actual output may vary based on the structure and data of the ORKG. 

    This is a sample solution. It may need to be modified based on the actual data and structure of the ORKG.
