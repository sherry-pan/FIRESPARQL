Question:
List the code links in papers that use the DDQN-PC model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?model       a            orkgc:Model;
                   rdfs:label      ?model_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "DDQN-PC model")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                       orkgp:P32               ?code.
       }     


```python
SELECT?code
WHERE {
 ?model       a            orkgc:Model;
              rdfs:label      ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "DDQN-PC model")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                  orkgp:P32               ?code.
}

Note: The above code was written in a way that it can be executed in the SPARQL query editor of the ORKG platform. The `?model_lbl` is assumed to be the label of the `?model`. The `?dataset` is not used in the query and can be removed if not needed. The `?cont` is also not used in the query and can be removed if not needed. The `?code` is the variable that is used to get the code links. The `?model` is used to filter the models and get the code links. The `?benchmark` is used to filter the benchmarks and get the code links. The `?cont` is used to get the contributions and get the code links. The `?model` and `?benchmark` are used to filter the models and benchmarks and get the code links. The `?model` is used to filter the models and
