Question:
List the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the DBpedia dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?title?id WHERE {
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_PUBLICATION?pub?paper orkgp:HAS_CONTRIBUTION?contribution?paper orkgp:CONTAINS?benchmark?paper orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset?dataset orkgr:RMatch "DBpedia"?dataset?dataset orkgr:RMatch "benchmark"?benchmark?benchmark } GROUP BY?paper?id FILTER ( REGEX ( STR(?title), ".*DBpedia.*") ) FILTER ( REGEX ( STR(?id), ".*\\d+.*") ) 

    Note: The above SPARQL query is already optimized for the given context, which may not be the case in general. The query is designed to retrieve the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the DBpedia dataset.
    Therefore, the query may need to be adjusted or modified based on the specific requirements of the application and the data available in the ORKG.
    The query is designed to retrieve the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the DBpedia dataset.
    In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider additional factors such as query performance, scalability, and security. 

```python
def generate_sparql_query(context):
    # Extract the extracted_terms and candidates from the context
    extracted_terms = context["extracted_terms"]
    candidates = context["candidates"]

    # Initialize the SPARQL query
    sparql_query = "SELECT?
