Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a            orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label   ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WOS-11967")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                       orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
      ?eval           orkgp:HAS_MODEL        ?model;
                       orkgp:P31              ?model_lbl.
     } 
     ORDER BY (DESC(?model_lbl)) 
     LIMIT 5
