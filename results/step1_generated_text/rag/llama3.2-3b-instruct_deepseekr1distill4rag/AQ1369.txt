Question:
What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset IMDb-B?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?metric?value
WHERE {
 ?dataset a vocab:Dataset.
 ?dataset vocab:datasetName "IMDb-B".
 ?benchmark a vocab:Benchmark.
 ?benchmark vocab:dataset?dataset.
 ?benchmark vocab:metric?metric.
 ?benchmark vocab:value?value.
  FILTER (str(?metric) = "accuracy" OR str(?metric) = "f1-score" OR str(?metric) = "roc-auc" OR str(?metric) = "ap")
}
``` 
    Note: The SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context information and the question. However, the actual query may need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data in the ORKG. The query filters the results to only include benchmark results with accuracy, f1-score, roc-auc, or ap as the metric. The actual metric and value of the top benchmark result over the IMDb-B dataset may not be included in the query results.<|eot_id|>
