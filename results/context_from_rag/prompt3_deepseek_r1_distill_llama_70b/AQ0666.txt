Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The user is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the ObjectNet dataset, along with their titles and IDs. 

First, I'll look through the context information to find any relevant data. The context includes several RDF triples from an ORKG dump. I see that there are two main resources mentioned: R147246 and R283710. Both of these seem to be papers or publications.

Looking at R147246, it has a P29 predicate with the value "2015" and P28 with "6". It also lists several authors. However, I don't see any direct mention of the ObjectNet dataset here. 

Next, R283710 is another resource with P29 as "2021" and P28 as "8". The authors are different, and again, I don't see a direct link to ObjectNet. 

The context also includes some information about methods and steps, like using SciBERT and CRF algorithms, but nothing specific to ObjectNet. 

Since the context doesn't explicitly mention the ObjectNet dataset or any benchmarks related to it, I can't extract any specific papers from the provided data. Therefore, the candidates for "research papers" and "benchmarks" would be empty, and the same goes for "ObjectNet dataset" since it's not present in the context.

I should structure the JSON response as per the example, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including the appropriate URIs and types, even if there are no matches. This way, the user gets a properly formatted answer, even if the data isn't available in the context.

```json
{
  "question": "Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the ObjectNet dataset?",
  "extracted_terms": {
    "research papers": [],
    "benchmarks": [],
    "ObjectNet dataset": []
  },
  "candidates": {
    "research papers": [],
    "benchmarks": [],
    "ObjectNet dataset": []
  }
}
```
