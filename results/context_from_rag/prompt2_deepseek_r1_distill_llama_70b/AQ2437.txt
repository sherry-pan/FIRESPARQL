Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The query is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the BiT-S (ResNet) model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of papers or models related to BiT-S or ResNet. The context has two main sections, each describing a resource. 

Looking at the first resource, R147652, it describes a method involving steps for named entity recognition. It mentions models like SVM and datasets like MNIST, but nothing about BiT-S or ResNet. The second resource, R284316, talks about a journal article focused on extracting entity knowledge using NLP techniques. It mentions tools like Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight but doesn't reference BiT-S or ResNet.

Since the context doesn't mention BiT-S or ResNet, I can't extract any relevant papers or code links from it. Therefore, the answer should indicate that no relevant information was found in the provided data.
