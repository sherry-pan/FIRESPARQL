Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the SciCite benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://orkgr.org/ontology/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://orkgc.org/ontology/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkgp.org/ontology/>
    SELECT?model?modelLabel
    WHERE {
       ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?modelModel.
       ?modelModel orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
       ?dataset orkgc:Dataset?datasetLabel.
       ?dataset orkgc:Dataset hasEvaluation?evaluation.
       ?model orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?evaluation.
       ?evaluation orkgc:Evaluation hasEvaluationOn?evaluationOn.
       ?evaluationOn a rdf:label?evaluationLabel.
       ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?modelModel.
       ?modelModel orkgc:Dataset?dataset.
       ?dataset orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
       ?dataset orkgc:Dataset?datasetLabel.
       ?dataset orkgc:Dataset hasEvaluation?evaluation.
       ?model orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?evaluation.
       ?evaluation orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model.
       ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model.
       ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model.
        BIND((?evaluationLabel?evaluationOn?datasetLabel)) AS?modelLabel.
        FILTER (?evaluationLabel!= "")
        }
    ```
``` 

    Note: You may need to adjust the SPARQL query based on the actual data structure of the ORKG, which may differ from the provided context. 
    The above SPARQL query is just one possible way to represent the query given the provided context. 
    Please adjust the SPARQL query according to the actual data structure of the ORKG. 
    The SPARQL query should be able to correctly query the ORKG and return the correct answer to the input question. 

    Note: This problem is about generating the correct SPARQL query based on the provided context. It does not require you to execute the query or retrieve the answer. 
    The goal is to generate the correct SPARQL query that can be used to query the ORKG and get the correct answer to the input question. 
    The correct answer is not required to be provided in this response. 

    The provided context includes the following information:
    1. Terms (entities and properties) mentioned in the question.
    2. Candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    The context includes the following information:
    1. Terms (entities and properties) mentioned in the question.
    2. Candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
