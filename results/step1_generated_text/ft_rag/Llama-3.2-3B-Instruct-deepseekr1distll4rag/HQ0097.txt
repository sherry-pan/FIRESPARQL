Question:
What types of nanocarriers do have therapeutic effect?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?nanocarriers?therapeutic_effects
     WHERE {
        ?nanocarriers  a       orkgc:Contribution;
                        rdfs:label ?nanocarriers_labels.
         FILTER(REGEX(?nanocarriers_labels, "nanocarriers"))
        ?therapeutic_effects       orkgp:HAS_THERAPEUTIC_EFFECT      ?contrib_therapeutic_effects.
        ?contrib                  a                orkgc:Contribution;
                                  rdfs:label          ?contrib_labels.
         FILTER(REGEX(?contrib_labels, "therapeutic"))
        ?contrib_therapeutic_effects     ?contrib       orkgp:HAS_THERAPEUTIC_EFFECT     ?therapeutic_effects.
     }
     LIMIT 5
``` 
    Please see below for the Python code that generates this SPARQL query. 

```python
def generate_sparql_query():
    query = """
    SELECT?nanocarriers?therapeutic_effects
    WHERE {
        ?nanocarriers  a       orkgc:Contribution;
                        rdfs:label ?nanocarriers_labels.
         FILTER(REGEX(?nanocarriers_labels, "nanocarriers"))
        ?therapeutic_effects       orkgp:HAS_THERAPEUTIC_EFFECT      ?contrib_therapeutic_effects.
        ?contrib                  a                orkgc:Contribution;
                                  rdfs:label          ?contrib_labels.
         FILTER(REGEX(?contrib_labels, "therapeutic"))
        ?contrib_therapeutic_effects     ?contrib       orkgp:HAS_THERAPEUTIC_EFFECT     ?therapeutic_effects.
     }
     LIMIT 5
    """
    return query

sparql_query = generate_sparql_query()
print(sparql_query)
``` 
    This code defines a function `generate_sparql_query()` that generates the SPARQL query. The function returns the query as a string. The query is then printed to the console. 

    Please note that this code does not include any error checking or handling. In a real-world application, you would want to add checks to ensure that the query is valid and can be executed successfully. 

    The code also assumes that the ORKG RDF data dump is available and can be queried. You would need to modify the code to connect to the data dump and execute the query. 

    The code is written in Python, but it can be easily adapted to other programming languages. 

    The SPARQL query is a basic example and may need to be modified to suit your specific use case. You may need to add additional filters, join tables, or modify the query to retrieve the desired data. 

    Please consult the ORKG documentation and the SPARQL specification for more information on how to write SPARQL queries and how to connect to the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    If you need further assistance or have questions, feel free to ask! 

    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions. 

    Happy querying!
