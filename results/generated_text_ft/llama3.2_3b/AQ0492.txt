Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the enwik8 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearch.org/orkg/>
     PREFIX wikibase: <http://wikibase.org/wikibase/wf/>
     SELECT?paper?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper a orkg:Paper.
     wikibase:label?paperLabel.
     wikibase:label?paperLabel rdfs:label?paperTitle.
     orkg:hasBenchmarkedModel?benchmarkedModel.
    ?benchmarkedModel orkg:hasDataset?benchmarkedDataset.
    ?benchmarkedDataset wikibase:label?benchmarkedDatasetLabel.
     filter (str(?benchmarkedDatasetLabel) = "enwik8".
       and str(?paperTitle) = "benchmarking" )
     } 

    Please provide the answer in the format specified above. 
    Output Answer:
    PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearch.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX wikibase: <http://wikibase.org/wikibase/wf/>
    SELECT?paper?id
    WHERE {
    ?paper a orkg:Paper.
     wikibase:label?paperLabel.
     wikibase:label?paperLabel rdfs:label?paperTitle.
     orkg:hasBenchmarkedModel?benchmarkedModel.
    ?benchmarkedModel orkg:hasDataset?benchmarkedDataset.
    ?benchmarkedDataset wikibase:label?benchmarkedDatasetLabel.
     filter (str(?benchmarkedDatasetLabel) = "enwik8" 
       and str(?paperTitle) = "benchmarking" )
     } 

    Note that the answer is the same as the query. This is because the question asked for a list of papers, 
    but the answer is not a list, but rather a single query. This query can be used to retrieve all papers 
    that match the specified criteria. To get the list of papers, you need to execute this query and parse the 
    results. 
    For example, you can use the SPARQL query execution tool to execute this query and get the results. 
    Alternatively, you can use a SPARQL client library to execute this query and parse the results. 
    If you need to get the list of papers, you need to execute this query multiple times with different 
    parameters and combine the results. 
    For example, you can use the `sparql` command-line tool to execute this query and get the results, 
    and then pipe the output to `sort` and `uniq` to get the list of papers. 
    Alternatively, you can use a programming language like Python to execute this query and parse the results. 
    For example, you can use the `requests` library to execute this query and get the results, and then parse 
    the results using a library like `xml.etree.ElementTree`.
