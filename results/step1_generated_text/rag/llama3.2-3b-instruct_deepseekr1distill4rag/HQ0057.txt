Question:
Where can all the data sets used in the compared studies be found?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

    SELECT?uri?label?type?rdf_type 
    WHERE {
     ?uri orkgc:resource?rdfs_label.
      FILTER (STR(?rdfs_label) = "MNIST" OR STR(?rdfs_label) = "ACL Anthology Corpus" OR STR(?rdfs_label) = "Journal Article")
     ?uri orkgr:data_sets?dataset_type.
     ?dataset_type a orkgc:Dataset.
     ?uri orkgc:resource?rdfs_label.
      FILTER (STR(?rdfs_label) = "R147246" OR STR(?rdfs_label) = "R284317")
     ?uri orkgr:compared_studies?study_type.
     ?study_type a orkgc:ResearchPaper.
    } 
    ``` 
    Note that the actual SPARQL query should be constructed using the provided RDF data, and the prefixes should be replaced with the actual prefixes used in the RDF data. The above query is just an example and may not work with the actual data. 

    The actual SPARQL query should be constructed by using the following logic:
    - Get all the resources with the label "MNIST", "ACL Anthology Corpus", and "Journal Article".
    - Get all the datasets associated with these resources.
    - Get all the resources with the label "R147246" and "R284317".
    - Get all the research papers associated with these resources.
    - Combine the results to get the final answer. 

    The actual SPARQL query will depend on the structure of the RDF data and the actual prefixes used. The above query is just an example and may not work with the actual data. 

    Note that the SPARQL query should be constructed using the following logic:
    - Use the `SELECT` clause to specify the variables to retrieve.
    - Use the `WHERE` clause to specify the conditions for retrieving the data.
    - Use the `FILTER` clause to filter the results based on the labels and types.
    - Use the `a` predicate to check if the resources are of the correct type.
    - Use the `or` predicate to combine the results for the datasets and research papers.
