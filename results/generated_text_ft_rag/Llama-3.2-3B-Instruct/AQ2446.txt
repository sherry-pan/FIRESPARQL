Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Shake-Shake (SAM) model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT DISTINCT?code
WHERE {
 ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
            rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "Shake-Shake (SAM)")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                  orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
}
```    END of codeblock.    



This is the SPARQL query that corresponds to the given input question. The query is designed to find papers that use the Shake-Shake (SAM) model and retrieve the links to their code. The query works as follows:

1. It first filters the models to only those with the label "Shake-Shake (SAM)".
2. Then, for each of these models, it finds the corresponding benchmarks.
3. For each of these benchmarks, it finds the corresponding papers.
4. For each of these papers, it finds the source code.
5. Finally, it selects the distinct source code values as the result.

Note that the query assumes that the ORKG dataset is properly indexed and that the RDF triples are correctly linked. Also, the query does not handle any potential errors or inconsistencies in the data.<|eot_id|>
