Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg#>
PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp#>
PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc#>

SELECT?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper orkp:has_benchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkp:includes?benchmark_included_by.
 ?benchmark_included_by orkp:includes?benchmark_included_in.
 ?benchmark_included_in orkp:includes?paper.
 ?paper orkp:has_id?id.
 ?paper orkp:has_title?title.
  FILTER (bn:dataset == "orkgr:R987654")
}
```


    Note that you will need to replace the PREFIX declarations with the actual URIs of the entities and properties in the ORKG. The `bn` prefix is used for the `Benchmark` class, but it is not explicitly mentioned in the context. The actual class URI should be replaced with the correct one. 

    For the purpose of this task, assume that the actual class URI for the `Benchmark` class is `http://example.org/orkp#Benchmark`. 

    Replace the `orkgr:R987654` in the FILTER clause with the actual URI of the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset in the ORKG.

    Replace the `orkgp:HAS_PAPER`, `orkgp:INCLUDES`, `orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK` with the actual URIs of the corresponding predicates in the ORKG.

    Replace the `orkgc:Resource` and `orkgc:Dataset` with the actual URIs of the corresponding classes in the ORKG.

    Finally, replace the `orkp:has_benchmark`, `orkp:includes`, `orkp:has_id`, and `orkp:has_title` with the actual URIs of the corresponding properties
