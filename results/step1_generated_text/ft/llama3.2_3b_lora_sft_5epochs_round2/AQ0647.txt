Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the WOS-46985 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
        ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                     rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WOS-46985")
        ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                         orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_PAPER  ?paper.
        ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?paper_lbl.
     }<|eot_id|>
