Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Stanford Cars dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
        FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Stanford Cars")
       ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                        orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
       ?paper         orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
       ?paper         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
      }<|eot_id|>
