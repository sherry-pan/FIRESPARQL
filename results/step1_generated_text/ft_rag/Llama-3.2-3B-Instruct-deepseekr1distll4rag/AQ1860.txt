Question:
Provide a list of benchmarked datasets related to the Reading Comprehension research area?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?dataset?dataset_lbl
WHERE {
 ?cont       a                orkgc:Contrib
 ?cont       rdfs:label      ?cont_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?cont_lbl) = "Reading Comprehension")
 ?cont       orkgp:P32       ?dataset.
 ?dataset   rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?cont_lbl)
LIMIT 5
```    Note: The above SPARQL query is based on the provided explanation and may not be the most efficient query. It's intended to demonstrate how to generate a SPARQL query based on the given context.<|eot_id|>
