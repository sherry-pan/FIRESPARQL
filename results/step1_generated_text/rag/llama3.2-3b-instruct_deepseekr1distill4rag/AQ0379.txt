Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the NLP-TDMS dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://orkgr.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://orkp.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkgr.org/predicate/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://orkgc.org/ontology/>

SELECT?paper?title?id 
WHERE {
 ?paper orkp:includes?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgp:hasBenchmarkFor?dataset.
 ?dataset orkg:label "NLP-TDMS dataset"@en.
 ?paper orkp:hasID?id.
 ?paper orkp:hasTitle?title.
}
``` 
    Note that the above SPARQL query assumes that the RDF data is stored in a triplestore and that the `rdf:type` property is not explicitly used in the query. The `rdf:type` property is used to specify the type of the subject and the predicate, and the `orkp:includes`, `orkgp:hasBenchmarkFor`, `orkp:hasID`, and `orkp:hasTitle` predicates are assumed to be defined in the ontology. 

    If the RDF data is stored in a graph database, the query would be slightly different. 

    Also note that the `@en` part is used to specify the language of the label, in this case English. If you want to retrieve labels in other languages, you can specify the language in the `orkg:label` predicate like this: `?dataset orkg:label?label?lang` and then filter the results based on the language in the `FILTER` clause. 

    Finally, you can use the `SERVICE` clause to specify a service that can be used to retrieve additional information about the results, for example, a web service that can be used to retrieve the full text of the papers.

    To run the SPARQL query, you can use a SPARQL query engine like SPARQLDB or Blazegraph, or a web-based SPARQL endpoint like SPARQL.org or QueryLog. 

    Please note that this is just an example query and you may need to adjust it based on the actual structure of your RDF data. 

    You can also use a tool like `sparqlcut` to generate the SPARQL query from the provided JSON output. 

    Please let me know if you need any further assistance. 

    The `sparqlcut` tool can be used to generate the SPARQL query from the provided JSON output. 

    Here is an example of how to use `sparqlcut` to generate the SPARQL query:

    ```bash
sparqlcut -i input.json -o output.sparql
```

    This will generate a SPARQL query from the provided JSON output and save it to a file named `output.sparql`. 

    Please note that you need to have `sparqlcut` installed on your system and the `input.json` file should be in the same directory as the `sparqlcut` executable. 

    Also, please note that `sparqlcut` is just a tool and the generated SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of your RDF data.
