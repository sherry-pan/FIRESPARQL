Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the BIOSSES dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/orkp/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/orkgp/>

SELECT?p?o?v
WHERE {
 ?o orkg:hasID?v.
 ?o orkp:hasTitle?v.
 ?o orkp:hasDataset?v.
 ?o orkp:hasBenchmark?v.
 ?o orkp:hasContribution?v.
  FILTER (regex(str(?v), "BIOSSES", "i"))
}
```sparql

Note: The provided SPARQL query is just one possible solution. There may be other correct solutions. The goal is to generate a valid SPARQL query that retrieves the correct information from the ORKG.
    If you want to know the correct answer to the input question, please execute the above SPARQL query on the ORKG and check the results. 
    The results should include a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the BIOSSES dataset. 
    The results may include multiple research papers and their corresponding titles and IDs. 
    You can further process the results to get the final answer to the input question. 
    The final answer is the list of research papers along with their titles and IDs. 

    Here is a sample output of the SPARQL query:
    ```markdown
|?p        |?o        |?v            |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| orkp:hasID | orkg:Contribution | orkg:R147246 |
| orkp:hasID | orkg:Contribution | orkg:R360
