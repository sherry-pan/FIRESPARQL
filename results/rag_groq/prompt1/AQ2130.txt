Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the query based on the given context. The query is asking for a list of papers that used the Large mLSTM model and include links to their code. 

First, I should look through the provided ORKG RDF data to find any mentions of papers. From the context, I see several resources labeled as "Paper". For example, R211524 is a paper titled "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire". Another one is R211922, titled "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)". There's also R211327, but its label isn't provided in the context. 

Next, I need to check if any of these papers mention the use of the Large mLSTM model. However, looking through the context, I don't see any specific mentions of "Large mLSTM" or "code links". The context provides labels and types but doesn't include detailed information about the models used or code availability.

Since the context doesn't have the necessary details, I can't directly retrieve papers that used the Large mLSTM model. Therefore, the answer should indicate that no relevant papers were found in the provided data. 

I should structure the response as a JSON list of dictionaries, each containing 'uri', 'label', and 'score'. Since no matches are found, the list will be empty.

To answer the query, we need to identify papers that utilized the Large mLSTM model and include links to their code. However, upon examining the provided context, there is no mention of the Large mLSTM model or any code links. Therefore, no relevant papers can be retrieved from the given data.
