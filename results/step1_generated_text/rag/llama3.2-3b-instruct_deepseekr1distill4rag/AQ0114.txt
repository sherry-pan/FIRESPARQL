Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the BoolQ dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset 
WHERE {
 ?model rdfs:label?label.
 ?model rdfs:label?modelLabel.
 ?model a orkg:Model.
 ?dataset a orkg:Dataset.
 ?model orkg:benchmarkedOn?dataset.
 ?dataset a orkg:BoolQ.
  BIND( filter(?label =?modelLabel ) AS?model ).
  BIND( filter(?dataset =?dataset ) AS?dataset ).
}
``` 
    Note: The SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context and the input question. The query is designed to retrieve the models that have been benchmarked on the BoolQ dataset from the ORKG. The query uses the `rdfs:label` property to retrieve the model labels, the `orkgp:Predicate` property to retrieve the benchmarking properties, and the `orkgc:Resource` property to retrieve the dataset URIs. The `filter` function is used to bind the model and dataset labels to their corresponding URIs.<|eot_id|>
