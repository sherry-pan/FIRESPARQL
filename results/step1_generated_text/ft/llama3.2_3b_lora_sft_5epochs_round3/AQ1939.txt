Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Concept Mention Extraction model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
        ?paper orkgp:P31?cont. 
        ?cont orkgp:P32?benchmark. 
        ?benchmark orkgp:P5049?cont.
        ?cont rdfs:label?cont_label.
         FILTER(REGEX(?cont_label, "Concept Mention Extraction", "i"))
        ?paper orkgp:P4316?code.
     }<|eot_id|>
