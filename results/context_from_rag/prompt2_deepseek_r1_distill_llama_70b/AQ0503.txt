Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the BIOSSES dataset, along with their titles and IDs.

First, I'll look through the context information. The context includes data from an ORKG RDF dump. I see two main resources: R147652 and R284316, and another resource R284317.

Looking at R147652, it describes a research method with five steps. It mentions using seed terms like SVM and MNIST, expanding with SciBERT and k-means, annotating training data, applying a CRF algorithm, and filtering entity candidates. This seems related to NER and entity linking, but I don't see a direct mention of BIOSSES.

Next, R284316 is a journal article titled "validation research" and is of type "Journal Article". It discusses extracting entity knowledge using a model called jpark, which uses background knowledge from YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata. The evaluation uses datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP. Again, no mention of BIOSSES here.

R284317 is another journal article with authors Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta, published in 2021. The URL is provided, but the title isn't explicitly mentioned. The context doesn't link this paper to BIOSSES either.

Since the context doesn't mention BIOSSES, I can't find any relevant papers. Therefore, the candidates list will be empty. I'll structure the JSON as per the example, extracting the necessary terms and returning an empty list for BIOSSES.
