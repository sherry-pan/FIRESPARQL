Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Pointer + Coverage + EntailmentGen + QuestionGen model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    SELECT?paper?code_reference 
    WHERE {
     ?paper a orkgc:Paper.
     ?paper orkgc:usesModel orkgr:Pointer_Coverage_EntailmentGen_QuestionGen_model.
     ?paper orkgc:hasPurpose orkgr:benchmarking_purpose.
     ?paper orkgc:hasCodeReference?code_reference.
     ?code_reference orkgp:hasURL?url.
     ?code_reference orkgp:hasDOI?doi.
    } 
    ``` 
    If you need to adjust the prefixes, you can do so by modifying the `PREFIX` statements. In this case, I've assumed that the prefixes are already defined in the RDF data dump. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to find papers that have used the Pointer + Coverage + EntailmentGen + QuestionGen model for benchmarking purposes, and have code references that include URLs and DOIs. The query uses the `orkgc:Paper` class, `orkgr:Pointer_Coverage_EntailmentGen_QuestionGen_model` as a model, `orkgr:benchmarking_purpose` as a purpose, and `orkgp:hasCodeReference`, `orkgp:hasURL`, and `orkgp:hasDOI` as predicates to find the desired properties. 

    Please note that this query assumes that the RDF data dump is already available and that the prefixes are correctly defined. The actual query may need to be adjusted based on the specific structure of the RDF data.
