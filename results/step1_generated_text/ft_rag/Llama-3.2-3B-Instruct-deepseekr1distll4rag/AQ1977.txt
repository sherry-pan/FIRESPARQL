Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the STREET model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/>
    SELECT?code
    WHERE {
     ?benchmark      orkgp:P31      ?cont.

    }

    You can ask this query to the ORKG by replacing the `PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/>` with the actual prefix for the ORKG in your dataset, or by removing the prefix and using the actual URIs. The query uses the `REGEX` function to match the "STREET model" and "code" in the model and code fields, and filters the results to only include resources with a score greater than 0.5. The `BIND` function is used to convert the label to an integer score, which is then filtered to ensure that the score is greater than 0.5. The `FILTER` function is used to filter the results based on the relevance of the model and code fields. The `?cont` variable is used to represent the contributions, and the `?paper` variable is used to represent the papers. The `?model` variable is used to represent the models, and the `?benchmark` variable is used to represent the benchmarks. The `?code` variable is used to represent the code references. The `?venue` variable is used to represent the venues. The `?label` variable is used to represent the labels. The `?score` variable is used to represent the scores.
