Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the SciCite dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?benchmark     orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
      ?dataset       orkgp:P31               ?ont.
      ?ont           rdfs:label              ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "SciCite")
      ?paper        orkgp:P31               ?cont.
      ?cont         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
      ?cont         orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
     }
     ORDER BY?paper_lbl<|eot_id|>
