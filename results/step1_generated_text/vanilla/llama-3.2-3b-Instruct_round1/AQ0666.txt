Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the ObjectNet dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX ork: <http://purl.org/sawz/ork/>
     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper a ork:Paper.
    ?paper ork:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark ork:hasObjectNetBenchmark?benchmarkObjectNet.
    ?benchmarkObjectNet ork:hasPaper?benchmarkObjectNetPaper.
    ?benchmarkObjectNetPaper ork:id?id.
    ?benchmarkObjectNetPaper ork:title?title.
     FILTER (CONTAINS(LCASE(?title), "objectnet") )
     }<|eot_id|>
