Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the WMT2016 German-English dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
      WHERE {
        orkgp:R123456?eval
     ?eval orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset
     ?dataset rdfs:label?dataset_lbl
      FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WMT2016 German-English dataset")
     ?eval orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?evalu
     ?evalu orkgp:HAS_PAPER?paper
     ?paper rdfs:label?paper_lbl
      }     



```python
SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
WHERE {
  orkgp:R123456?eval
 ?eval orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset
 ?dataset rdfs:label?dataset_lbl
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WMT2016 German-English dataset")
 ?eval orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?evalu
 ?evalu orkgp:HAS_PAPER?paper
 ?paper rdfs:label?paper_lbl
}
```



Note that the actual ID for the query `orkgp:R123456` will need to be replaced with the actual ID of the query that corresponds to the question "Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the WMT2016 German-English dataset?". This ID can be obtained from the ORKG. 



The SPARQL query can be used to query the ORKG to retrieve the required information. The query works as follows:
- It selects two variables, `?paper` and `?paper_lbl`, which will hold the values of the paper and its title, respectively.
- It then queries the graph to find all queries (`orkgp:R123456`) that have an evaluation (`?eval`).
- For each evaluation, it checks if the evaluation is associated with a dataset (`?dataset`). If it is, it checks if the label of the dataset matches the WMT2016 German-English dataset. If it does, it continues to the next step.
- For each evaluation that is associated with the WMT2016 German-English dataset, it checks if the evaluation has
