Okay, so I need to figure out which model has the highest Perm Accuracy on the sequential MNIST benchmark. Let me start by breaking down the question. The key terms here are "model," "Perm Accuracy," and "sequential MNIST benchmark."

First, I'll look for any mentions of "sequential MNIST" in the context. From the provided data, I see that there's a resource R147656 with a P28 value of "93.9". That seems like a high accuracy score. The resource is labeled as "MNIST" and is of type "orkgc:Dataset." So, this is likely the sequential MNIST benchmark.

Next, I need to find models associated with this dataset. Looking through the context, I see that R147244 has a HAS_VALUE of "93.9" and is linked to R147246. R147246 is connected to R147247 via HAS_VENUE, and it's a "Dataset." The authors listed are Ligia Sierra, Betthy L López, Flavio Forni, Maria Angela Vandelli, Michele Zolli, and Antonietta Vilella. This suggests that their model achieved a high accuracy on the MNIST dataset.

I also notice that R147244 is linked to R147246, which is the dataset. So, the model in question is probably associated with these authors. Since the accuracy is 93.9, which is the highest mentioned, this model must be the one with the top score.

I don't see any other models in the context with higher accuracy scores on MNIST, so this must be the top candidate. Therefore, the model by Ligia Sierra and her team is the one that achieved the highest Perm Accuracy on the sequential MNIST benchmark.
