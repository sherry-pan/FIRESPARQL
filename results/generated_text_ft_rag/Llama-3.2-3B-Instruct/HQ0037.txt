Question:
Who has contributed to the largest number of articles about coronavirus?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?contributor?contributor_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?contributor       a            orkgc:Contributor;
                         rdfs:label      ?contributor_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?contributor_lbl) = "coronavirus")
      ?paper           orkgp:P30     ?contributor.
     }
     ORDER BY (count(?contributor_lbl) DESC)
     LIMIT 5
``` 
    SPARQL Query:
     SELECT?contributor?contributor_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?contributor       a            orkgc:Contributor;
                         rdfs:label      ?contributor_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?contributor_lbl) = "coronavirus")
      ?paper           orkgp:P30     ?contributor.
     }
     ORDER BY (count(?contributor_lbl) DESC)
     LIMIT 5
``` 
    This query assumes that the contributor is the person who has contributed to the paper, and that the contributor's label is the same as the paper's label. It filters out any papers that do not have the label "coronavirus", and then orders the remaining papers by the number of contributors. The `LIMIT 5` clause is used to limit the output to the top 5 papers with the most contributors. However, since there is no data in the provided context that mentions "coronavirus", this query will not return any results. 

    To answer the question, we should instead look for the top 5 contributors to papers that mention "coronavirus". We can do this by changing the query to filter out papers that do not have the label "coronavirus", and then ordering the remaining papers by the number of contributors. We can also add a `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by contributor, and a `ORDER BY` clause to order the results by the number of papers contributed to. Here is the modified query:

    ```sparql
    SELECT?contributor?contributor_lbl
    WHERE {
     ?contributor       a            orkgc:Contributor.
      FILTER (str(?contributor_lbl) = "coronavirus")
     ?paper           orkgp:P30     ?contributor.
     ?contributor      rdfs:label      ?contributor_lbl.
    }
    GROUP BY?contributor?contributor_lbl
    ORDER BY (count(?contributor_lbl) DESC)
    LIMIT 5
    ``` 

    This query will return the top 5 contributors to papers that mention "coronavirus", along with the number of papers they have contributed to. However, since there is no data in the provided context that mentions "coronavirus", this query will not return any results. 

    To get the correct answer, we need to look at the data in the context and find the top 5 contributors to papers that mention "coronavirus". Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain enough information to answer the question. 

    Therefore, the correct answer is an empty list.

    ```json
    []
    ``` 

    This is the correct answer. The empty list indicates that there are no relevant contributors to papers that mention "coronavirus" in the provided context.
