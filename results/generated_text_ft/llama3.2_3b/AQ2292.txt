    Note: The SPARQL query uses the following prefixes:
    - orkg: for Open Research Knowledge Graph
    - wdt: for Wikidata property "directLinkTo"
    - rdfs: for RDF Schema property
    - p: for PURL ontology
    - dcterms: for Dublin Core terms
    - lang: for natural language
    - LIMIT 10 is used to limit the number of results. 
    This query can be executed using a SPARQL query engine like SPARQL.js or PySparql. 
    You can also use the SPARQL query in a database or a web service to get the desired results. 
    The query will return the paper title, code, and a link to the code.
    The query will return the results in English language only. 
    If there are more than 10 papers that have utilized the C51 noop model, the query will return only the first 10 results. 
    The query will return the paper title, code, and a link to the code for the papers that have utilized the C51 noop model. 
    The query will not return the paper title, code, and a link to the code for the papers that do not have utilized the C51 noop model. 
    The query will return the results in the following format:
   ?paper?paperTitle?code
   ?paper "Link to paper"
   ?paper "https://example.com/code"
    If there is only one paper that has utilized the C51 noop model, the query will return only one result.
    If there are no papers that have utilized the C51 noop model, the query will return an empty result set.
    This query is case-insensitive, meaning that it will return results for papers that have utilized the C51 noop model regardless of the case of the paper title. 
    The query will return results for papers that have utilized the C51 noop model regardless of the case of the code. 
    The query will return results for papers that have utilized the C51 noop model regardless of the case of the language of the paper title. 
    The query will return results for papers that have utilized the C51 noop model regardless of the case of the language of the code. 
    The query will return results for papers that have utilized the C51 noop model regardless of the case of the language of the link to the code.
