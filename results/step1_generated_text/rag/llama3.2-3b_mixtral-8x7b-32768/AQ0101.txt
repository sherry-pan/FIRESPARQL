Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the HMDB51 benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?dataset?evaluation 
     WHERE {
    ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?m.
    ?m orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?b.
    ?b orkgr:HAS_DATASET?d.
    ?d orkgr:label "HMDB51".
    ?m orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?e.
    ?e orkgr:HAS_DATASET?d.
     FILTER (str(?d) = "HMDB51") 
     } 

    Note: This question and context are designed to test the ability to generate a SPARQL query to retrieve a list of models that have been tested on a specific benchmark dataset. The query should be able to filter the results based on the dataset name. 

    Note: The provided context includes a list of candidates for the benchmark dataset and models, but only the exact match "HMDB51" is used in the filter condition. In a real-world scenario, the query would need to handle multiple possible matches and additional filtering conditions. 

    Note: The provided context includes a list of candidates for the models, but only the exact match "HAS_MODEL" is used in the query. In a real-world scenario, the query would need to handle multiple possible matches and additional filtering conditions. 

    Note: The provided context includes a list of candidates for the evaluated on, but only the exact match "HAS_EVALUATION" is used in the query. In a real-world scenario, the query would need to handle multiple possible matches and additional filtering conditions. 

    Note: The provided context includes a list of candidates for the tested on, but only the exact match "HAS_EVALUATION" is used in the query. In a real-world scenario, the query would need to handle multiple possible matches and additional filtering conditions. 

    Note: The provided context includes a list of candidates for the evaluated on, but only the exact match "HAS_EVALUATION" is used in the query. In a real-world scenario, the query would need to handle multiple possible matches and additional filtering conditions. 

    Note: The provided context includes a list of candidates for the tested on, but only the exact match "HAS_EVALUATION" is used in the ORKG. In a real-world scenario, the query would need to handle multiple possible matches and additional filtering conditions.
