Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The user is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the MMV TSM-50x2 model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information to find any mentions of the MMV TSM-50x2 model. Scanning through the RDF data, I see that there are several resources and predicates, but none of them directly mention "MMV TSM-50x2". The context talks about methods like SVM and MNIST, and some papers from 2015 and 2021, but nothing about the specific model in question.

Since the model isn't present in the provided data, I can't extract any relevant papers or code links. The context doesn't include any information about this particular model, so there are no entities or properties to retrieve.

I should inform the user that based on the given context, there's no information available about the MMV TSM-50x2 model. Therefore, I can't provide a list of papers or code links related to it.
