Question:
What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset ARC (Challenge)?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric,?value
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "ARC (Challenge)")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
      ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?eval          orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                      orkgp:HAS_VALUE        ?value.
       OPTIONAL {?eval           orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.}
     }
     LIMIT 5
``` 
    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the top benchmark results for the ARC Challenge dataset. It first filters the dataset labels to find the ARC Challenge dataset. Then, it retrieves the benchmark results for that dataset and the evaluations of those benchmarks. Finally, it retrieves the metrics and values of those evaluations. The LIMIT 5 clause is used to limit the number of results returned. However, since there are no relevant benchmark results for the ARC Challenge dataset, the query will return an empty list. 

    Please note that the provided context information is used to generate the SPARQL query. The context includes the explanation of the problem and the discussion of the relevant triples in the RDF data. It is used to understand the requirements of the problem and to generate the correct SPARQL query. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the top benchmark results for the ARC Challenge dataset. However, since there are no relevant benchmark results for the ARC Challenge dataset, the query will return an empty list. 

    The SPARQL query is as follows:

         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "ARC (Challenge)")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
      ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?eval          orkgp:HAS_VALUE        ?value.
       OPTIONAL {?eval           orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.}
     }
