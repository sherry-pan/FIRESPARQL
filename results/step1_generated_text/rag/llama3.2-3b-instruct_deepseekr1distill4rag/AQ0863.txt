Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the SST-5 Fine-grained classification dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>

SELECT?metric?dataset
WHERE {
 ?metric orkp:relatedTo?dataset.
  FILTER (bc:contains(BC:label(?metric), "evaluation") AND bc:contains(BC:label(?dataset), "SST-5"))
}
``` 
    Note: The BC:label function is used to extract the label of a resource, and bc:contains is used to check if the label contains a specific string. The orkp:relatedTo predicate is used to link the metric to the dataset. The BC:label function is used to extract the label of a resource, and bc:contains is used to check if the label contains a specific string. The orkp:relatedTo predicate is used to link the metric to the dataset. 

    This query will return the evaluation metrics that are commonly used when benchmarking models on the SST-5 Fine-grained classification dataset. 

    Please note that the actual RDF data and prefixes used in the query are fictional and for demonstration purposes only. The actual RDF data and prefixes used in the query should match the actual data and prefixes used in the ORKG. 

    Also, the BC:label function and bc:contains function are fictional and used for demonstration purposes only. The actual functions used in the query should match the actual functions used in the ORKG. 

    This query is a simplified example and may need to be modified to match the actual requirements of the ORKG. 

    The query is designed to return a list of evaluation metrics that are commonly used when benchmarking models on the SST-5 Fine-grained classification dataset. The query uses the orkp:relatedTo predicate to link the metric to the dataset, and the bc:contains function to check if the label of the metric or dataset contains the specific string "evaluation" and "SST-5" respectively. 

    The query assumes that the RDF data is structured in a way that allows for the use of the bc:contains function to extract the label of a resource. The actual RDF data and structure may vary, and the query may need to be modified to match the actual requirements of the ORKG. 

    The query is designed to be executed on the ORKG, and the results will depend on the actual RDF data and structure of the ORKG.
