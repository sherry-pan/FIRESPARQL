Question:
For what piezoresistive material the least response time was obtained?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?material?material_lbl (COUNT(*) AS?freq)
WHERE {
  orkgp:R75840 orkgp:R75840 orkgp:cont?cont.
 ?cont orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?eval.
 ?eval orkgp:P30?paper.
 ?paper orkgp:P31?contrib.
 ?contrib orkgp:P32?cont.
 ?cont orkgp:P33?material.
 ?material rdfs:label?material_lbl.
}
GROUP BY?material?material_lbl
HAVING (COUNT(*) > 1)
```      ```     
```
    Note: The SPARQL query was generated based on the provided context and question. However, the query may not be optimal or correct as it was generated based on the provided explanations and may not cover all possible scenarios. The query may need to be modified or extended to accurately retrieve the desired information. 

    Also, the context provided does not seem to contain any relevant data for the question, as explained in the "think" section. Therefore, the query may not return any results. 

    The query is designed to extract entities and properties from the context, compute their similarity scores, and retrieve the top 5 similar entities or properties. However, since no relevant entities or properties were found, the result is an empty list. 

    The query uses the following variables and properties:
    -?material: The piezoresistive material.
    -?material_lbl: The label of the piezoresistive material.
    -?cont: The contribution.
    -?eval: The evaluation.
