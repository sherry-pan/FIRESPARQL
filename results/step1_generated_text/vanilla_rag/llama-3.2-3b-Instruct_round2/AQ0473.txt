Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Rotowire (Content Selection) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>

     SELECT?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset "Rotowire (Content Selection)".
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Titles?title.
    ?benchmark orkg:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
    ?paper orkg:hasMethod?method.
     FILTER (REGEX(STR(?title), "Rotowire (Content Selection")i)
     }<|eot_id|>
