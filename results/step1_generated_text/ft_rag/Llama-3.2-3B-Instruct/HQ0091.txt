Question:
What is Raman spectroscopy?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?value
     WHERE {
        ?paper orkgp:P21?value.
         FILTER(REGEX(?value, "raman"))
     }
     LIMIT 10
``` 
    The final answer is not a number, so I'll provide the correct output as a string. 

    ```
SELECT?value
WHERE {
   ?paper orkgp:P21?value.
    FILTER(REGEX(?value, "raman"))
}
LIMIT 10
``` 
    Note that the actual answer is an empty list, but the format requires a string. The provided SPARQL query will return an empty list of values, which is the correct result given the context. 

    Please note that the provided answer is not a number, but a string containing the SPARQL query. 

    Also, the actual answer is empty because there is no relevant information in the provided context. 

    The provided answer is a string that contains the SPARQL query.
