Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given context. The query is asking for a list of papers that used the Tokenlearner model and include links to their code. 

First, I should look through the provided ORKG RDF data to find any mentions of the Tokenlearner model. Scanning through the context, I don't see any resources labeled "Tokenlearner." That's a problem because if it's not in the data, I can't retrieve any information about it.

Next, I check if there are any related terms or similar models mentioned. The context includes various resources like "BabelEnconding," "looked at different ways to measure similarity between embeddings," "IBM Journal of Research and Development," "Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study," and others. None of these seem related to Tokenlearner.

Since the Tokenlearner model isn't present in the provided data, I can't find any papers or contributions associated with it. Without any matching entities, the similarity scores would all be zero, indicating no relevant results.

Therefore, the answer should reflect that no relevant entities were found in the given data. The JSON output should list these entities with their URIs, labels, and scores, all zero since they're not related to the query.

To address the query, we need to identify papers using the Tokenlearner model from the provided ORKG data. However, upon examining the context, the Tokenlearner model isn't mentioned. As a result, no relevant entities are found. Here's the JSON response:
