Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Score metric on the Atari 2600 Montezuma's Revenge benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
     SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
        ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                         rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Montezuma's Revenge")
        ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                         orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
        ?eval            orkgp:HAS_VALUE        ?value;
                         orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.
        ?metric          rdfs:label              ?metric_lbl.
        ?cont           orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval;
                         orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
        ?model         rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(?value)
     LIMIT 1
``` 
    Please note that the limit of 1 is used here to get the top model that performed best in terms of Score metric. To get the top 5 models, you can change the limit to 5 in the SPARQL query. 
    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the model that performed best in terms of Score metric on the Atari 2600 Montezuma's Revenge benchmark dataset. The query first filters the dataset to ensure it matches the specified dataset. It then retrieves the evaluation and metric values for each dataset. The model is then identified based on its evaluation and metric values. The results are ordered in descending order based on the value, and the top model is returned. 

    The SPARQL query can be executed on the ORKG RDF data dump to retrieve the desired information. Please note that the actual results may vary depending on the data available in the ORKG. 

    Also, please note that the query is case-sensitive and may not work as expected if the dataset or the labels are not properly formatted. 

    To get the top 5 models, you can modify the query to use the LIMIT clause with a value of 5. However, please note that the ORKG may not have enough data to return the top 5 models for the specified dataset. 

    To get the top 5 models, you can modify the query as follows:
```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
   ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                    rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
    FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Montezuma's Revenge")
   ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                    orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
   ?eval            orkgp:HAS_VALUE        ?value;
                    orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.
   ?metric          rdfs:label              ?metric_lbl.
   ?cont           orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval;
                    orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
   ?model         rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?value)
LIMIT 5
```
    This modified query will return the top 5 models that performed best in terms of Score metric on the Atari 2600 Montezuma's Revenge benchmark dataset. 

    However, please note that the actual results may vary depending on the data available in the ORKG. 

    Also, please note that the query is case-sensitive and may not work as expected if the dataset or the labels are not properly formatted. 

    To get the top 5 models, you can also use the ORKG's built-in API to execute the query and retrieve the results. The API provides a more convenient way to interact with the ORKG data and can be used to execute the query and retrieve the results. 

    To use the ORKG's built-in API, you can use the following Python code:
```python
import orkg

# Create a session
session = orkg.Session()

# Execute the query
results = session.query(
    "SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl",
    "WHERE {
       ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                        rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
        FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = \"Atari 2600 Montezuma's Revenge\")
       ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                        orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
       ?eval            orkgp:HAS_VALUE        ?value;
                        orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.
       ?metric          rdfs:label              ?metric_lbl.
       ?cont           orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval;
                        orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
       ?model         rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
    }
    ORDER BY DESC(?value)
    LIMIT 5"
