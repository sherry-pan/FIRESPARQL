    Note: This query uses the'regex' function to filter the benchmark results by the dataset name, 
    and the 'ORDER BY' clause to sort the results in descending order by score. 
    The 'LIMIT 1' clause is used to get the highest benchmark result. 
    The 'FILTER' clause is used to filter the results to only include the benchmark results that contain the dataset name. 
    The 'SELECT' clause is used to select the metric and score of the highest benchmark result. 
    The 'PREFIX' clauses are used to define the prefixes for the ORKG, RDF, RDFS, and XSD ontologies. 
    The'regex' function is used to match the benchmark result with the dataset name. 
    The '@i' argument is used to make the match case-insensitive.
