Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the query: "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the A3C LSTM hs model and include links to their code?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "papers" and the "A3C LSTM hs model". The action is "utilized", which implies a relationship between the papers and the model. Also, the question mentions including "links to their code", so I need to consider properties related to code or implementation.

Looking at the context information, I see several resources. For example, R147246 is a paper with authors and a venue, and R284316 is another paper with a detailed description. I need to find which of these papers mention the A3C LSTM hs model. 

I'll search through the RDF data for any mentions of "A3C LSTM hs". Scanning through, I don't immediately see any direct references to this model. However, R284316 discusses entity recognition and linking, which might be related to models like A3C LSTM hs, but it's not explicitly stated.

Next, I'll look for properties that link papers to models or code. The predicates like P26 and p27 might be relevant, but they don't directly point to code. The URL and DOI properties could be useful for linking to code, but again, I don't see explicit links to the A3C model.

Since the model isn't directly mentioned, I might have to infer based on related topics. For example, R284316 talks about NER and entity linking, which could use models like A3C LSTM hs. But without explicit data, it's a stretch.

I'll also check if any papers have URLs or DOIs that might lead to code repositories. R284317 has a URL, but it's a DOI link to a paper, not code. 

In conclusion, based on the provided data, there's no explicit mention of the A3C LSTM hs model. Therefore, I can't provide a list of papers that used it. However, I can suggest looking into papers related to NER and entity linking, as they might use similar models, even if not explicitly stated here.
