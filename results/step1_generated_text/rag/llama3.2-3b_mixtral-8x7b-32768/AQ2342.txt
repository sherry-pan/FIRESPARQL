Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the DQNMMCe+SR model for benchmarking purposes?

    Note: You can assume that the provided URIs (e.g., orkg:R123456) are correct and exist in the ORKG.
    You can also assume that the provided predicates (e.g., orkg:R123456) are correct and exist in the ORKG.
    The provided context contains the correct entities and properties that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question. 
    The SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context.
    You can ignore the context information as it is not required for the output. 
    The output SPARQL query should be able to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question. 
    The SPARQL query should be able to filter papers that have used the DQNMMCe+SR model for benchmarking purposes and get the code references for those papers. 
    The query should also filter papers that have used the DQNMMCe+SR model for benchmarking purposes and get the code references for those papers. 
    The query should be able to handle the different URIs and
