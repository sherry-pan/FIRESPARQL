Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What are the models that have been benchmarked on the WMT2014 English-German dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by understanding the structure of the data. The context information includes several RDF triples from two different files. Each triple has a subject, predicate, and object. The subjects are resources like R147652 and R284316, which seem to represent different entities such as steps in a process, research papers, and their attributes.

Looking at the first file, I see that R147652 has multiple P39020 predicates with string values that describe steps in a process. These steps talk about seed terms, expansion using TSE and SciBERT, annotation, applying a NER approach with CRF, and filtering. This seems to be a method or process description, possibly related to named entity recognition or a similar task.

Then, there are other resources like R147244, which has a HAS_VALUE of "93.9". This could be a metric like accuracy or F1 score. R147246 is connected to several P27 predicates, which list authors: Ligia Sierra, Betty L LÃ³pez, Flavio Forni, Maria Angela Vandelli, Michele Zoli, and Antonietta Vilella. It also has P29 as "2015" and P28 as "6", which might indicate the year and volume of a publication. The HAS_VENUE is another resource, possibly the conference or journal where this paper was published.

Moving to the second file, R284316 has several predicates. P97004 is "validation research", P97005 is "technique", and P5044 is "Journal Article". The P37015 predicate contains a detailed abstract about a study on extracting entity knowledge using NLP tools and a probabilistic model called jpark. This model uses background knowledge from YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata to improve annotations from NERC and EL tools. The evaluation uses datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP, and tools like Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL. The results show improved performance.

R284317 is another resource with P27 listing authors Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta. It has a url predicate with a DOI link and a P26 which seems to be the same as the DOI. The publication year is 2021, volume 11, and the venue is another resource.

Now, the question is about models benchmarked on the WMT2014 English-German dataset. From the context, I don't see any direct mention of WMT2014 or any specific models related to machine translation benchmarks. The first file talks about NER models using CRF and the second about NLP tasks, but not specifically machine translation or the WMT dataset.

However, I can infer that the process described in R147652 might be a model or method that could be benchmarked on various datasets. The second paper discusses models like Stanford NER, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL, but these are for NER and entity linking, not machine translation.

Since the WMT2014 dataset isn't mentioned, I might need to look for any dataset mentions. The second file's abstract mentions AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP datasets, but not WMT. Therefore, there's no direct information about models benchmarked on WMT2014 English-German.

But perhaps the process described in R147652 could be a model. Let's see: Step 1 mentions seed terms like SVM and MNIST. SVM is a machine learning model, and MNIST is a dataset. Steps 2-5 describe expanding terms, annotating data, applying NER with CRF, and filtering. So, the model here is likely a NER model using CRF.

In the second file, the models mentioned are NER tools like Stanford NER and Flair NER. These could be considered as models benchmarked on certain datasets, but again, not WMT2014.

Given that, I might have to consider that the context doesn't provide specific models for WMT2014. However, perhaps the process in R147652 is a model that could be benchmarked on various datasets, including WMT2014, even if it's not explicitly stated.

Alternatively, maybe the authors in R147246 or R284317 have published models that could be relevant, but without more context, it's hard to say.

So, putting this together, the extracted terms from the question are "models" and "WMT2014 English-German dataset". The candidates would be the models mentioned in the context, even if they aren't specifically linked to WMT2014.

Looking at the context, the models mentioned are SVM, CRF, Stanford NER, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL. However, SVM and CRF are more general. The specific models are the NER tools.

Therefore, the top candidates for "models" would be these NER models, and for the dataset, since WMT2014 isn't present, perhaps the closest is the MNIST dataset mentioned in Step 1, but that's for a different task.

Wait, but the question is about models benchmarked on WMT2014, which isn't in the context. So, perhaps the answer is that there are no models in the provided data that are benchmarked on WMT2014. But the task requires selecting top candidates even if not exact.

Alternatively, perhaps the process described is a model that could be benchmarked on any dataset, so it's a candidate.

In conclusion, the extracted terms are "models" and "WMT2014 English-German dataset". The candidates for models are the NER models mentioned, and for the dataset, perhaps none, but since the dataset isn't present, maybe the MNIST dataset is the closest, though it's not relevant.

But since the user expects a JSON with candidates, I'll proceed to structure it accordingly, noting that the dataset isn't found but including the models that are present.
