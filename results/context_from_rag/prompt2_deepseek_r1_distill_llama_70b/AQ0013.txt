Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the CommonsenseQA dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "models" and "CommonsenseQA dataset". The property connecting them is "evaluated on". So, I have two key terms to focus on: "models" and "CommonsenseQA dataset".

Next, I need to compute the similarity between these terms and the entities in the RDF data. Looking at the context, I see mentions of models like SVM and possibly others, but the main focus is on the process steps. However, the RDF data provided doesn't explicitly list models evaluated on CommonsenseQA. So, I might need to infer based on the information given.

In the context, there's a detailed description of a method involving NER and entity linking, which mentions models like Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL. These could be considered as models evaluated on certain datasets, but the datasets mentioned are AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP, not CommonsenseQA.

Since the specific dataset in the question isn't present in the context, I have to look for the closest matches. The models mentioned in the context are the ones used in the evaluation, so I can list them as candidates. The properties related to evaluation, like "validation research" and "technique", might also be relevant.

I'll structure the JSON output as specified, grouping the results by the extracted terms. For "models", I'll include the ones mentioned in the context with their URIs and labels. For "CommonsenseQA dataset", since it's not present, I'll look for similar datasets or create a placeholder. However, since the exact dataset isn't found, I'll have to note that or find the closest match, which might be "validation research" as a property.

I need to ensure that the URIs use the correct prefixes and that the types are accurately assigned. Each candidate should have a similarity score, which I'll estimate based on relevance.

Finally, I'll compile the JSON, making sure it's correctly formatted with the extracted terms and their respective candidates, including scores and types.
