Okay, I need to figure out if the paper titled "Disambiguating authors in citations on the web and authorship correlations" uses Cosine similarity. Let me start by looking through the provided context information to see if there's any mention of this paper or the method it uses.

First, I'll scan the context. I see several resources like R147244, R147246, R283709, and R283710. Each of these seems to be papers or publications with various properties. For example, R147246 has authors like Ligia Sierra and Flavio Forni, and it was published in 2015. R283709 is a journal article from 2021 with topics like graph analytics and named entity recognition.

I'm looking for any mention of "Disambiguating authors in citations on the web and authorship correlations." I don't see this exact title in the context. Maybe it's not present, or perhaps it's referred to differently. Alternatively, maybe the context doesn't include this specific paper.

Next, I check if any of the papers mentioned use Cosine similarity. Looking at R283709, the methods include keyphrase extraction, named entity recognition, and graph analytics. There's no explicit mention of Cosine similarity here. R147246's details also don't mention this method.

Since the context doesn't provide information about the specific paper in question, I can't confirm whether it uses Cosine similarity. Without more data, I can't retrieve any relevant candidates from the RDF data provided.
