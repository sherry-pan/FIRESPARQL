Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the DuIE dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearch.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://www.openresearch.org/orkp/>
PREFIX orkc: <http://www.openresearch.org/orkc/>

SELECT?model?modelLabel
WHERE {
 ?model orkp:hasBenchmark orkp:BenchmarkedOn?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkp:hasDataset orkp:Dataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkg:label?datasetLabel.
 ?model orkp:hasModel orkp:Model?modelLabel.
 ?dataset orkp:hasDataset orkp:Dataset?datasetLabel.
  BIND(STR(?datasetLabel) AS?datasetLabel).
  FILTER(LONG(?datasetLabel) > 0)

    Note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be further refined and optimized based on the actual structure of the ORKG and the data it contains. The query provided here is a possible solution based on the information provided in the context. 

    Please note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be further refined and optimized based on the actual structure of the ORKG and the data it contains. The query provided here is a possible solution based on the information provided in the context. 

    This solution assumes that the dataset label is a numeric value and uses the FILTER function to exclude any datasets with non-numeric labels. 

    This solution also assumes that the model label is a string value and uses the BIND function to convert the dataset label to a string. 

    The query also assumes that the model has a model label, and the dataset has a dataset label. 

    The query also assumes that the benchmarking relationship is represented by the orkp:hasBenchmark property, and the dataset relationship is represented by the orkp:hasDataset property. 

    The query also assumes that the model relationship is represented by the orkp:hasModel property, and the dataset label is represented by the orkg:label property. 

    The query also assumes that the dataset label is a numeric value and uses the FILTER function to exclude any datasets with non-numeric labels.
