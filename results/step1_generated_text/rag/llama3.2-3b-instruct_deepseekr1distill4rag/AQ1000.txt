Question:
List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the VTAB-1k benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?metric
WHERE {
 ?model rdfs:label?modelLabel.
 ?dataset rdfs:label "VTAB-1k benchmark dataset".
 ?model orkgp:used_to_evaluate?dataset.
 ?metric rdfs:label?metricLabel.
  FILTER (str(?metricLabel) =~ "accuracy" || str(?metricLabel) =~ "F1-score" || str(?metricLabel) =~ "precision" || str(?metricLabel) =~ "recall" || str(?metricLabel) =~ "AUC-ROC" || str(?metricLabel) =~ "AUC-ROC" || str(?metricLabel) =~ "AP" || str(?metricLabel) =~ "AP" || str(?metricLabel) =~ "MCC")
  }
```    Note: The above SPARQL query is a direct translation of the provided JSON output into a SPARQL query. The query is designed to retrieve the metrics used to evaluate models on the VTAB-1k benchmark dataset. The query uses the `orkgp:used_to_evaluate` predicate to link models to the dataset, and then filters the results to include only metrics with labels that match common evaluation metrics (accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, AUC-ROC, AUC-ROC, AP, AP). 

    Please note that the filtering condition is a simple string match and might not cover all possible evaluation metrics. A more sophisticated filtering condition might be needed to capture all relevant metrics. 

    Additionally, the query assumes that the `orkgp:used_to_evaluate` predicate is correctly linked to the `orkgp:Validation_Research` and `orkgp:Technique` predicates, which are mentioned in the provided context. 

    Finally, the query uses the `str(?metricLabel)` function to convert the metric labels to strings, which is necessary to perform the string matching. 

    The query can be executed on the ORKG to retrieve the metrics used to evaluate models on the VTAB-1k benchmark dataset.<|eot_id|>
