Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to answering the question: "Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the SciCite dataset?" 

First, I'll break down the question. The user is asking for research papers, specifically their titles and IDs, that have used the SciCite dataset for benchmarks. So, I need properties related to papers, their titles, IDs, datasets, and benchmarks.

Looking at the JSON properties, I see several that could be relevant. 

1. "has benchmark" (property: HAS_BENCHMARK) seems directly related because it indicates if a paper has performed any benchmarks.
2. "has dataset" (property: HAS_DATASET) would link the paper to the specific dataset used, which in this case is SciCite.
3. "title" (property: CSVW_Titles) is necessary to get the titles of the papers.
4. "ID" (property: CSVW_Number) would provide the unique identifiers for each paper.
5. "method" (property: HAS_METHOD) could be useful to understand how the benchmarks were conducted, though it's slightly less direct.

I should list these properties with their IRIs and explain why each is relevant. I'll make sure not to reference the context directly and avoid any markdown formatting as per the instructions.

Here is the list of relevant properties from the JSON file that could help answer the question:

[
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_BENCHMARK",
    "label": "has benchmark",
    "reason": "This property indicates whether a research paper has performed benchmarks, which is directly relevant to the question."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_DATASET",
    "label": "has dataset",
    "reason": "This property specifies the dataset used in the benchmarks, which is crucial for identifying papers that used the SciCite dataset."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/CSVW_Titles",
    "label": "titles",
    "reason": "This property provides the titles of the research papers, which is part of the requested information."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/CSVW_Number",
    "label": "number",
    "reason": "This property could represent the IDs of the research papers, which is part of the requested information."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_METHOD",
    "label": "method",
    "reason": "This property describes the methods used in the research, which could include details about the benchmarks performed on the SciCite dataset."
  }
