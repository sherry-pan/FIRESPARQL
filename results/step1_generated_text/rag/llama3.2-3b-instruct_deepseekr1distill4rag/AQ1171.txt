Question:
What is the top benchmark score and its metric on the MultiNLI dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?s?p?o
WHERE {
 ?s a orkg:Resource.
 ?s orkg:label?sLabel.
  FILTER (str(?sLabel) = "93.9" OR str(?sLabel) = "MultiNLI_dataset" OR str(?sLabel) = "benchmark score" OR str(?sLabel) = "metric").
 ?s orkg:has_value?o.
 ?o a orkg:Property.
 ?s orkg:has_value?o.
}
```    Note: The output SPARQL query is a basic query that extracts all the values that match the extracted terms. It may need to be further refined based on the actual data in the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    If you need to refine the query, please provide the actual data in the ORKG RDF data dump and I can help you create a more specific query. 

    Also, note that this query assumes that the URIs in the RDF data dump are in the format `orkgr:<uri>`. If the URIs are in a different format, you may need to adjust the query accordingly. 

    Additionally, this query uses the `str(?sLabel) = "..."` pattern to match the extracted terms, which may not be the most efficient way to query the data. Depending on the actual data, you may be able to use more specific patterns or filters to improve the query's performance. 

    If you need further assistance or have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. 

    Finally, please note that this query is just a starting point, and you may need to refine it further based on the actual data in the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    If you have any further questions or need any additional assistance, please don't hesitate to ask. 

    The final answer is the SPARQL query itself.
