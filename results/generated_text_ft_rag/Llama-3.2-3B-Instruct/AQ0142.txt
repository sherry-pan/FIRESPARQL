Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the MultiNLI dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model
     WHERE {
      ?model orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?eval.
      ?eval orkgp:P31?cont.
      ?cont rdfs:label?cont_lbl.
       FILTER(REGEX(?cont_lbl, "MultiNLI"))
      ?cont orkgp:P2?dataset.
      ?dataset orkgp:P31?ven.
      ?ven rdfs:label?ven_lbl.
       FILTER(REGEX(?ven_lbl, "dataset"))
      ?cont orkgp:P3?model.
       FILTER(REGEX(?model_lbl, "model"))
     }  
     ORDER BY DESC(?cont_lbl)
     LIMIT 5
```

    This SPARQL query first finds models that have been evaluated on the MultiNLI dataset. It does this by finding contributions that have been evaluated on a dataset that mentions "MultiNLI" and then filtering the results to only include models. The results are then ordered by relevance and limited to the top 5.<|eot_id|>
