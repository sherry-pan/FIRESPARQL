Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the ART/CoreSC benchmark dataset. The question is about listing the metrics used, so I should focus on properties related to evaluation, benchmarks, and metrics.

Looking through the JSON, I see properties like "evaluation" with label "evaluation" and "has benchmark" with label "has benchmark". These seem directly related because they likely contain information about how models are assessed.

There are also several properties related to F1 scores, like "micro-F1" and "macro-F1". These are common metrics used in evaluations, so they should be included.

Accuracy and Recall are also standard evaluation metrics, so their corresponding properties are relevant too.

Properties like "has dataset" and "implementation" might provide context about the dataset and how models are implemented, which could be useful for understanding the evaluation setup.

I should make sure to include all these properties and explain why each is relevant. That should cover the necessary metrics for evaluating models on the benchmark dataset.

Here is the list of relevant properties from the JSON file that could help answer the question about the metrics used to evaluate models on the ART/CoreSC benchmark dataset:

```json
[
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_EVALUATION",
    "label": "evaluation",
    "reason": "This property is directly related to evaluation, which is central to understanding the metrics used for assessing model performance."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_BENCHMARK",
    "label": "has benchmark",
    "reason": "Benchmarks are standards against which model performance is measured, making this property highly relevant."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71080",
    "label": "micro-F1",
    "reason": "Micro-F1 is a common metric used to evaluate model performance, especially in classification tasks."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71082",
    "label": "macro-F1",
    "reason": "Macro-F1 provides a broader view of model performance across different classes, complementing micro-F1."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71081",
    "label": "Accuracy",
    "reason": "Accuracy is a fundamental metric that measures the proportion of correct predictions made by a model."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71079",
    "label": "Recall",
    "reason": "Recall is another key metric that assesses a model's ability to detect all instances of a particular class."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_DATASET",
    "label": "has dataset",
    "reason": "This property provides information about the dataset used, which is essential for understanding the evaluation context."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_IMPLEMENTATION",
    "label": "implementation",
    "reason": "Details about the model implementation can influence the choice and application of evaluation metrics."
  }
]
