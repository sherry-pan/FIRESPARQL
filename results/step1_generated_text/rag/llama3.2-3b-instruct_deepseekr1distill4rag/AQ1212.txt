Question:
What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the BC5CDR-chemical dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

    SELECT?dataset?metric?value 
    WHERE {
     ?dataset a orkgc:Dataset.
     ?dataset orkgc:hasBenchmarkResult?result.
     ?result a orkgc:BenchmarkResult.
     ?result orkgp:hasMetric?metric.
     ?metric orkgp:hasValue?value.
     ?dataset orkgr:BC5CDR-chemical_dataset.
     ?result rdfs:label?label.
      FILTER (str(?label) = "highest benchmark result")
    }
    ```
