Question:
What is the name of the top performing model in terms of Accuracy (High) score when benchmarked on the RACE dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/rdf/>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/rdf property/>
    SELECT?model?dataset
    WHERE {
     ?model orkp:hasAccuracyHighScore?score.
     ?score orkp:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
     ?benchmark orkp:hasDataset?dataset.
     ?dataset orkp:hasName?name.
      FILTER (str(?name) = "RACE")
      BIND (str(?model) AS?model)
      BIND (str(?dataset) AS?dataset)
    }
    ```
    Please note that the RDF prefixes used here are placeholders, and you should replace them with the actual prefixes used in the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Note: The actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the RDF data in the ORKG.
