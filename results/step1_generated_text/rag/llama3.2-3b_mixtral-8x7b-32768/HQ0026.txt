Question:
Which QA benchmarks incorporating more than 10000 questions?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?uri?rdfs:label?rdf:type 
     WHERE {
   ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?incorp
    {?incorp orkgp:HAS_INCORPORATION?q 
      filter(?q orkgp:HAS_QUESTION "more than 10000" ) 
    } 
    {?benchmark orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset 
      filter(?dataset orkgp:HAS_QUESTION "more than 10000" ) 
    } 
    filter (count(?q) > 10000 ) 
    }
    ORDER BY (?benchmark rdfs:label) 
    LIMIT 10
``` 
    To generate the SPARQL query, I will follow the steps below:
1. Identify the entities and properties mentioned in the input question.
    From the input question, the entities and properties mentioned are:
    - QA benchmarks
    - incorporating
    - more than 10000 questions
    - uri (from the context)
    - rdfs:label
    - rdf:type
    - orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK
    - orkgp:HAS_INCORPORATION
    - orkgp:HAS_DATASET
    - orkgp:HAS_QUESTION
2. Identify the candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    From the context, the candidate entities and properties are:
    - QA benchmarks: orkgr:R122689, orkgr:R131168, orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK, orkgp:HAS_DATASET
    - incorporating: orkgp:HAS_INCORPORATION
    - more than 10000 questions: orkgp:HAS_QUESTION
    - uri: orkgr:R122689, orkgr:R131168
    - rdfs:label: orkgr:R122689, orkgr:R131168
    - rdf:type: orkgr:R122689, orkgr:R131168
3. Determine the relationships between the entities and properties mentioned in the question and the candidate entities and properties.
    From the context, the relationships can be determined as follows:
    - QA benchmarks are linked to orkgr:R122689, orkgr:R131168, orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK, orkgp:HAS_DATASET
    - Incorporating is linked to or
