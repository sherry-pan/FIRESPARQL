Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the Atari 2600 Assault dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model a ora:Model.
 ?model ora:evaluatedOn?dataset.
  FILTER (REGEX(str(?dataset), "Atari 2600 Assault") || REGEX(str(?dataset), "MNIST") || REGEX(str(?dataset), "AIDA") || REGEX(str(?dataset), "MEANTIME") || REGEX(str(?dataset), "TAC-KBP"))
}
```    Note: The SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context and question. The query is designed to retrieve the models that have been evaluated on the specified datasets, including the Atari 2600 Assault dataset if it exists, or any of the other datasets mentioned in the context. If no models are found, the query will return no results.<|eot_id|>
