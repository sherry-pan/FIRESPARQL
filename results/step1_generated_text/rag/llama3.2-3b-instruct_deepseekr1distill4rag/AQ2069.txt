Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the FABIR model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?code?link
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:Paper.
 ?paper orkg:hasCode?code.
 ?paper orkg:hasLink?link.
 ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark "FABIR model".
  SERVICE orkg:search { BIND(strcat("http://example.org/",?paper) AS?uri) }
}
``` 
    Note: The example RDF data dump is not provided, so the SPARQL query will not execute successfully. 

    Please replace "http://example.org/" with the actual base URI of the ORKG. 

    This query will return all papers that benchmark the FABIR model, along with their corresponding code and links. 

    Note that the actual query might need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data dump and the structure of the ORKG. 

    The example provided is just a sample and might need to be modified to match the actual requirements. 

    Please consult the ORKG documentation for more information on how to construct SPARQL queries.
