Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the Atari 2600 Space Invaders dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Space Invaders")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?model         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                  orkgp:P32               ?model.
 ?model_lbl     rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
}
```    end of code block.    
    The output of this code block is the SPARQL query to answer the input question. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the models that have been benchmarked on the specified dataset. The query first filters the dataset to only include the one with the label "Atari 2600 Space Invaders". Then, it retrieves the models that have been benchmarked on the filtered dataset, and finally, it retrieves the labels of the models. The query uses the ORKG RDF data dump and the provided context to answer the input question. 

    The query is based on the assumption that the input question is about models that have been benchmarked on a specific dataset. The query filters the dataset to only include the one with the specified label and then retrieves the models that have been benchmarked on the filtered dataset. The query uses the ORKG RDF data dump and the provided context to answer the input question. 

    The query is designed to be efficient and accurate, and it takes into account the context provided to ensure that the correct entities and properties are retrieved. The query uses the `FILTER` function to filter the dataset and the `SELECT` statement to retrieve the models and their labels. The query uses the `WHERE` clause to specify the conditions for the query. 

    The query is designed to be flexible and can be modified to answer different questions. The query can be modified to include additional filters or to retrieve different types of data. The query can also be used as a starting point for further analysis or as a component of a larger query.
