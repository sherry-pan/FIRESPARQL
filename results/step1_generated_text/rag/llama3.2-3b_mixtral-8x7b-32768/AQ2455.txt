Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the XLNet (base) model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.com/orkg/>

    SELECT?paper?paperCode
    WHERE {
       ?paper orkp:HAS_PAPER?code.
       ?paper orkp:HAS_PAPER?paperCode.
       ?paper orkp:UTILIZES_MODEL?model.
       ?model orkp:UTILIZES_MODEL?modelBase.
       ?modelBase orkp:UTILIZES_MODEL?modelBaseBase.

        FILTER (STR(?paperCode) = "https://huggingface.co/models/xxlnet-base-uncased")
    }
    ``` 
    Note that the actual model name and code repository URLs may vary. The above query is just a sample query. 

    This query is based on the provided context and the entities and properties mentioned in the question. It first identifies papers that have utilized the XLNet (base) model, and then filters the results to only include papers that have links to their code repository, specifically for the base XLNet model. 

    Please note that this query assumes the existence of specific predicates (properties) and resources (entities) in the ORKG, which may not be the case in the actual ORKG. The actual query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG. 

    The actual SPARQL query may need to be further optimized and refined based on the actual data in the ORKG. 

    Please let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the query or provide further clarification.
