Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the PROTEINS dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "PROTEINS")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
      ?paper         orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?model        rdfs:label              ?model_lbl;
                     orkgp:P31               ?paper;
                     orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
     }     ORDER BY DESC(?eval)
```     END SPARQL Query     ```


      Note: The above SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question. The query will return the models that have been evaluated on the PROTEINS dataset. However, since the PROTEINS dataset is not present in the ORKG data, the query will return models that have been evaluated on similar datasets or tasks. The query uses the `FILTER` clause to filter the results based on the dataset label, and the `ORDER BY` clause to sort the results in descending order based on the evaluation count.<|eot_id|>
