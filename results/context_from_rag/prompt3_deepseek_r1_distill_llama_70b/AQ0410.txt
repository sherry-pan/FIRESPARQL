Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the NYT24 dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "research papers" and "NYT24 dataset". The property mentioned is "contain a benchmark over". So, I'm looking for papers that have a benchmark using the NYT24 dataset.

Next, I'll look through the provided context to find similar entities and properties. From the context, I see that there are resources related to papers, such as R147246 and R283710, which have properties like P27 (authors), P28 (issue), P29 (year), and so on. There's also a mention of "Benchmark" in the context, like R283709 having P97003 as "entity extraction".

I need to find papers that are connected to benchmarks and the NYT24 dataset. However, in the given context, I don't see any direct mention of the NYT24 dataset. The closest related terms are "MNIST" and "SVM" in the initial steps, but those are different datasets. 

Since the NYT24 dataset isn't present, I'll have to consider that maybe the context doesn't have the specific information needed. But I can still structure the answer based on the available data. For example, R147246 is a paper with authors and publication details, and R283710 is another paper with similar information. 

I'll map these papers as candidates, even though they might not be directly related to the NYT24 dataset. The properties I'll include are P31 (is a), HAS_VENUE, P29 (year), P28 (issue), and P27 (authors). 

I'll structure the JSON output as specified, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including the relevant URIs and labels. Since the exact dataset isn't found, the candidates will be general papers from the context.
