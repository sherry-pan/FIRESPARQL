```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?code
WHERE {
  ?paper a orkgc:Paper;
         rdfs:label ?paper_lbl;
         orkgp:HAS_MODEL ?model.
  FILTER (str(?paper_lbl) = "Pointer + Coverage + EntailmentGen + QuestionGen")
  
  ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_PAPER ?paper;
  ?dataset orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK ?benchmark.
  
  ?cont orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK ?benchmark;
        orkgp:HAS_MODEL ?model;
        orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE ?code.
  
  ?code rdfs:label ?code_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?code_lbl) = "code")
}
ORDER BY DESC(?cont)
LIMIT 10
```

Note: I have simplified the query by removing unnecessary repetitions and ensuring clarity. Also, it is assumed that benchmarking information is indirectly linked via the dataset. Adjust namespace prefixes as needed.
