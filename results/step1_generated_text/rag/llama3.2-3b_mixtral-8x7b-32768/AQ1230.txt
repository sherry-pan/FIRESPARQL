Question:
Can you provide the highest benchmark result, including the metric and score, for the Ball in cup, catch (DMControl100k) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp#>
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr#>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc#>
    SELECT?metric?score
    WHERE {
       ?dataset orkgc:hasDataset orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
       ?dataset orkgr:label "DMControl100k"@en.
       ?dataset orkgp:HAS_RESULT?result.
       ?result orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
       ?result orkgp:HAS_SCORE?score.
        FILTER (str(?metric) = "highest benchmark result"@en).
        FILTER (str(?score) = "score"@en).
       ?result orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
    }
    ```



## Step 1: Understand the context provided
The context includes the question, extracted terms, and candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant entities and properties
From the context, we can see that the relevant entities and properties are:
- "Ball in cup, catch (DMControl100k) dataset"
- "metric"
- "score"
- "highest benchmark result"
- "Has Best Result"
- "Has Metric"
- "Has Score"
- "Has Dataset"

## Step 3: Determine the relationships between entities and properties
Based on the context, we can see that:
- The "Ball in cup, catch (DMControl100k) dataset" has a "Has Dataset" relationship.
- The "highest benchmark result" is related to the "Has Best Result" predicate.
- The "metric" and "score" are related to the "Has Metric" and "Has Score" predicates respectively.

## Step 4: Construct the SPARQL query
Using the relationships determined in the previous step, we can construct the SPARQL query to retrieve the highest benchmark result, including the metric and score, for the Ball in cup, catch (DMControl100k) dataset.

## Step 5: Write the SPARQL query
The SPARQL query can be written as:
```
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/
