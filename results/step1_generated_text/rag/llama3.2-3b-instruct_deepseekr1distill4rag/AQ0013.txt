Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the CommonsenseQA dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?m?mLabel?d
WHERE {
 ?m a ora:Model.
 ?m ora:evaluatedOn?d.
  FILTER (str(?d) = "CommonsenseQA")
}
``` 
    This SPARQL query retrieves the models that have been evaluated on the CommonsenseQA dataset. The query filters the results to only include models that have been evaluated on the specified dataset. The `ora:Model` and `ora:evaluatedOn` predicates are used to link the models to the evaluation process, and the `ora:evaluatedOn` property is used to filter the results to only include models evaluated on the CommonsenseQA dataset. The `str(?d) = "CommonsenseQA"` filter is used to ensure that only the specified dataset is considered. The query returns the model URIs, labels, and the dataset URIs. 

    The query uses the following variables:

    - `?m`: The URI of the model.
    - `?mLabel`: The label of the model.
    - `?d`: The URI of the dataset.

    The query returns the results in the following format:

    - `?m`: The URI of the model.
    - `?mLabel`: The label of the model.
    - `?d`: The URI of the dataset.

    The query is designed to retrieve the models that have been evaluated on the CommonsenseQA dataset, and the results are formatted to match the expected output. 

    This SPARQL query can be executed on the ORKG to retrieve the models that have been evaluated on the CommonsenseQA dataset. 

    Note: This query assumes that the `ora:Model` and `ora:evaluatedOn` predicates are correctly defined in the ORKG. 

    The query can be modified to accommodate changes in the ORKG or to retrieve additional information. 

    This query can be used as a starting point for further analysis or as a basis for more complex queries. 

    The query can be executed on a SPARQL endpoint or a SPARQL query builder to retrieve the results. 

    The results can be used to answer the original question or to inform further research. 

    The query can be used to retrieve models that have been evaluated on other datasets by modifying the `str(?d) = "CommonsenseQA"` filter. 

    The query can be used to retrieve models that have been used for other tasks by modifying the `ora:evaluatedOn` predicate. 

    The query can be used to retrieve models that have been developed for other applications by modifying the `ora:Model` predicate.
