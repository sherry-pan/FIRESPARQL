Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the DQN-PixelCNN model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information. I see two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a method with five steps, including using a CRF algorithm. R284316 is a journal article about extracting entity knowledge using a model called jpark. 

I don't see any mention of DQN-PixelCNN in the context. DQN-PixelCNN isn't referenced in any of the provided triples. So, there's no direct information about papers using this model or their code links.

Since the context doesn't have the necessary data, I can't retrieve any relevant papers or code links. Therefore, the candidates for DQN-PixelCNN and code links will be empty.
