Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query based on the provided context. The question is asking to list the code links in papers that use the LSTM (Bai et al., 2018) model in any benchmark. 

First, I'll break down the query. The key terms here are "code links," "papers," "LSTM model," and "benchmark." So, I need to extract these terms and find relevant information from the context.

Looking at the context, I see two main resources: R147652 and R284316, R284317. R147652 describes a method with five steps involving NER and CRF algorithms. R284316 and R284317 are about a paper titled "validation research" with a URL "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075" and another with a DOI "10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075."

I need to find if any of these papers mention the LSTM model. R147652 doesn't mention LSTM, but R284316's abstract talks about NLP tasks and models like Stanford NER and Flair NER, but not LSTM. R284317 has a URL and DOI, but no mention of LSTM either.

Since the context doesn't explicitly mention the LSTM model, I can't find any direct matches. However, I can look for papers that have code links and might be related to models. R284317 has a URL which could be a code link, but it's not clear if it's related to LSTM.

So, I'll structure the answer by extracting the terms: "code links," "papers," "LSTM model," and "benchmark." For each term, I'll look for similar entities in the context. Since there's no direct mention of LSTM, the candidates will be based on general relevance.

For "code links," the URL in R284317 is a candidate. For "papers," both R147652 and R284317 are papers. For "LSTM model," there's no match, so I'll include general models mentioned, like SVM from R147652. For "benchmark," R147652 mentions MNIST, which is a benchmark dataset.

I'll assign similarity scores based on how relevant each candidate is. Since none directly mention LSTM, the scores will be lower but still relevant based on context.
