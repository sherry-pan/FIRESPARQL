Question:
What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset BUCC French-to-English?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric?value
     WHERE {
     orkgp:R1 orkgp:P1?metric.
    ?metric orkgp:P1 orkgp:R1?value.
     FILTER(REGEX(STR(?value), "^[0-9.]+$"))
     FILTER(REGEX(STR(?metric), "^[a-zA-Z]+$"))
     FILTER(REGEX(STR(?metric), "^[a-zA-Z]+$"))
     FILTER(REGEX(STR(?value), "^[0-9.]+$"))
     }
    Note: The provided answer is based on the assumption that the top result is the one with the highest value.
    If the question is modified to ask for the worst result, the filter conditions for value and metric would be changed accordingly. 

    Please do not use the provided answer as the final solution. You are expected to use the provided context and question to generate the correct SPARQL query.
    The correct answer should be based on the provided context and question, not the provided answer. 
    You are expected to generate the correct SPARQL query from the given context and question. 

    To generate the correct SPARQL query, please follow these steps:
    1. Identify the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    2. Look up the candidates in the provided context for the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    3. Construct the SPARQL query based on the identified entities and properties, and the candidates provided in the context.
    4. Use the identified entities and properties, as well as the candidates, to generate the correct SPARQL query.
    5. Verify that the generated SPARQL query is correct and complete. 
    6. Provide the correct SPARQL query as the final answer.
