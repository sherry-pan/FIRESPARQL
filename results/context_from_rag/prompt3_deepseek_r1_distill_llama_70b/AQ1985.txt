Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking for a list of papers that used the BART model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "papers" and "BART model". The property mentioned is "utilized" or "include links to their code". 

Looking at the context, I see several resources related to papers. For example, R147246 and R283710 are both papers with authors and publication details. Since the user is asking about papers that used BART, I need to find papers that mention BART. However, in the context, I don't see any direct mention of BART. 

But I can still proceed by identifying the papers in the context. R147246 is from 2015 with multiple authors, and R283710 is from 2021 with different authors. These are the two main papers in the context. 

Next, I need to consider the properties. The user wants links to code, so I should look for properties related to code or implementation. In the context, I don't see specific properties for code links, but I can infer that "HAS_VALUE" or "HAS_VENUE" might be relevant, though they don't directly point to code. 

Since the context doesn't have explicit mentions of BART or code links, I'll have to structure the answer based on the available papers and their details. I'll list the two papers as candidates under "papers" and note that there's no specific information on code links in the provided data.

I'll make sure to format the JSON correctly, using the appropriate prefixes for URIs and including the necessary types. Each candidate will have a URI, label, and type. 

So, the final answer will include the two papers as candidates for "papers" and note that there are no matches for "BART model" or "include links to their code" in the context.
