Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the query: "List the code links in papers that use the FQF model in any benchmark?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "FQF model" and "code links." The properties involved are "use" (as in papers that use the model) and "benchmark." So, I'm looking for papers that use the FQF model and have code links associated with any benchmark.

Next, I'll look through the provided context to find any mentions of the FQF model or related terms. Scanning the context, I see that there are resources like R147652 and R284316, which describe steps for NER approaches and entity linking. However, I don't see any direct mention of "FQF model" in the context. This might mean that the FQF model isn't present in the provided data, or it's referred to by another name or URI.

Since the FQF model isn't explicitly mentioned, I might need to look for related models or concepts. For example, R147652 talks about using a CRF algorithm, which is a type of model, but it's not FQF. R284316 discusses jpark, a probabilistic model for entity linking, but again, not FQF.

Looking for code links, I check the URLs provided. R284317 has a URL "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075" and a DOI "10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075." These could be code links if the paper associated with this resource uses the FQF model, but without explicit mention, it's unclear.

I also notice that the context includes information about models like SVM and datasets like MNIST, but these aren't relevant to FQF. The steps described in R147652 involve NER and entity linking, which might be related, but without the FQF model being named, it's hard to connect.

Given that the FQF model isn't present in the context, I might have to consider that there are no relevant code links available in the provided data. Alternatively, if FQF is another name for one of the models mentioned, I could infer a connection, but that's speculative.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, there's no direct information about the FQF model or associated code links. Therefore, the candidates list would be empty for the FQF model, but I can include the existing code link from R284317 as a potential related resource, even though it's not explicitly linked to FQF.
