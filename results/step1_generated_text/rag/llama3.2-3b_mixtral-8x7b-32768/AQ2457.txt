Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the COMET - Direct model?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?code?link 
     WHERE {
    ?paper rdf:type oksgc:Paper.
    ?paper orkgc:hasCode?code.
    ?code orkgp:hasLink?link.
    ?paper orkgp:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkgp:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
    ?evaluation orkgp:hasEvaluationTarget?target.
    ?target orkg:label "COMET - Direct model"@en.
     FILTER (STRLEN(?target) = 23)
     }
     END { } 

```

## Step 1:  Identify the key entities and properties mentioned in the question.
The key entities and properties mentioned in the question are: "COMET - Direct model", "papers", "benchmark", and "code".

## Step 2:  Identify the candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
The candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question are: "COMET - Direct model" with URI "orkgr:R44252", "papers" with URIs "orkgr:R147246" and "orkgr:R36054", "benchmark" with URI "orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION", and "code" with URI "orkgp:HAS_CODE".

## Step 3:  Determine the relationships between the entities and properties.
The relationships between the entities and properties are: "papers" are related to "benchmark" through "hasBenchmark", and "code" is related to "benchmark" through "hasEvaluationTarget", and "code" is related to "papers" through "hasCode".

## Step 4:  Construct the SPARQL query based on the relationships determined in step 3.
The SPARQL query can be constructed as follows:
- Select the "papers" that have "hasBenchmark" with "benchmark" that has "hasEvaluationTarget" with "target" that has label "COMET - Direct model"@en.
- Filter the results to only include papers that have exactly 23 characters in their label.

## Step 5:  Write the final SPARQL query.
The final SPARQL query is:
```
SELECT?paper?code?link 
WHERE {
 ?paper rdf:type oksgc:Paper.
 ?paper orkgc:hasCode?code.
 ?code orkgp:hasLink?link.
 ?paper orkgp:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgp:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
 ?evaluation orkgp:hasEvaluationTarget?target.
 ?target orkg:label
