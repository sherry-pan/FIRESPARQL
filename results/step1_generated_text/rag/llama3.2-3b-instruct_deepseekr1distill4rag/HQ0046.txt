Question:
Are children examined in the studies?

Generated SPARQL:

     ?study orkp:hasSubject?subject.
     ?subject a orkgc:Demographic.
      FILTER (str(?subject) = "children" || str(?subject) = "participants" || str(?subject) = "subjects")
    }
    ```    Note: The output is a SPARQL query, not a JSON response. The query is based on the provided context and the extracted terms. The query is trying to find studies that have children or are examining children as participants. The query uses the `orkg:hasFocusArea` and `orkp:hasSubject` properties to link studies to their subjects and focus areas. The `FILTER` clause is used to narrow down the results to only include studies that have children or are examining children as participants. The `str(?subject) = "children" || str(?subject) = "participants" || str(?subject) = "subjects"` clause is used to match the subject with the extracted terms. 

    Please note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG RDF data dump. The query above is based on the provided context and the extracted terms. 

    Also, please note that this is just one possible SPARQL query that can be generated based on the provided context and extracted terms. There may be other possible queries that can also achieve the desired results. 

    The SPARQL query is based on the following assumptions:

    - The `orkg:hasFocusArea` property links a study to its focus area.
    - The `orkp:hasSubject` property links a study to its subject.
    - The `orkgc:Demographic` class represents demographic categories.
    - The `str(?subject) = "children" || str(?subject) = "participants" || str(?subject) = "subjects"` clause is used to match the subject with the extracted terms.

    Please adjust the query based on the actual structure of the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Also, please note that this is a simplified example and may not cover all possible cases. 

    The actual SPARQL query may need to be more complex to handle all possible cases.
