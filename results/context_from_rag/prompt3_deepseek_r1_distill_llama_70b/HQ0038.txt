Okay, so I need to figure out the mean capacity of a carbon-based fuel. Hmm, I'm not exactly sure what "mean capacity" refers to here. It could be about energy capacity, storage capacity, or something else. Since the question is about carbon-based fuels, I'm thinking it's related to energy content, maybe like how much energy is released when the fuel is burned.

Looking at the context provided, I see a lot of RDF data. There are entries about research projects, entities, and some metrics. For example, there's a resource R147244 with a value of "93.9". I'm not sure what that value represents, but it could be a capacity measurement. However, without more context, it's hard to tell.

I also see mentions of various entities like "SVM" and "MNIST", which are related to machine learning, not directly to fuels. There are steps described in the context that talk about expanding seed terms and using NER approaches, which seems more about data processing than fuel capacities.

The other part of the context discusses a study analyzing funded projects, organizations, and deliverables, using a knowledge graph approach. They mention keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition, which again seems more about data analysis rather than fuel capacities.

I don't see any specific information about carbon-based fuels or their capacities in the provided context. The terms extracted from the question are "carbon-based fuel" and "mean capacity". The context doesn't have any entities or properties that directly relate to these terms. The closest might be some metrics like "93.9", but without knowing the unit or what it measures, it's not helpful.

So, based on the context given, there's no relevant information to answer the question about the mean capacity of a carbon-based fuel. The context is more about data processing and research projects rather than fuel specifications.

The provided context does not contain information related to carbon-based fuels or their capacities. Therefore, it's not possible to determine the mean capacity from the given data.
