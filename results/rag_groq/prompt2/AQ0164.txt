Alright, I need to figure out how to answer the question "What models are being evaluated on the TempEval-3 dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break it down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "models" and "TempEval-3 dataset". The property implied is "evaluated on".

Next, I'll look through the context information to find similar entities and properties. From the context, I see mentions of models like SVM and possibly others, and datasets like MNIST. There's also a mention of a research paper about entity recognition which might relate to models.

I'll compute the cosine similarity between the extracted terms and the entities in the context. For "models", SVM and the CRF algorithm from the context seem relevant. For "TempEval-3 dataset", MNIST is a close match. The property "evaluated on" relates to how models are applied to datasets.

Finally, I'll select the top 5 candidates for each term based on their similarity scores and structure the JSON output accordingly.
