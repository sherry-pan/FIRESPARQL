Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Rotowire (Content Selection) benchmark dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. 

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "metrics" and "Rotowire (Content Selection) benchmark dataset". The property mentioned is "used to evaluate". 

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates related to evaluation. For example, in the first file, there's a resource R147652 which describes a method involving steps like applying NER approaches and using CRF algorithms. This might relate to how models are evaluated.

I also notice that there are other resources like R147244 which has a value of "93.9", possibly a metric. Then, R283709 and R283710 discuss various methods and solutions, including keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition, which are related to models and their evaluation.

Since the question is about metrics used on the Rotowire dataset, I should look for any mentions of metrics or evaluation in the context. However, the provided data doesn't explicitly mention Rotowire or specific metrics like ROUGE or BLEU, which are common in such contexts. 

But I can infer that metrics are often associated with evaluation methods. So, I'll look for predicates related to evaluation. In the context, I see P5044, P41924, P97005, etc., which might be relevant. Also, resources like R147244 with a value of "93.9" could be a metric.

I'll structure the answer by grouping the extracted terms and listing the candidates. For "metrics", I'll include any resources that represent evaluation metrics. For "Rotowire (Content Selection) benchmark dataset", I'll look for any benchmark-related resources, even if they aren't a direct match. The property "used to evaluate" will link these together.

I'll make sure to use the correct RDF prefixes and include the necessary types. Since the exact Rotowire dataset isn't present, I'll include the closest matches from the context, like R147652 and R283709, which discuss evaluation steps and methods.

Finally, I'll format the JSON as specified, ensuring each term has its candidates with URIs, labels, and types.
