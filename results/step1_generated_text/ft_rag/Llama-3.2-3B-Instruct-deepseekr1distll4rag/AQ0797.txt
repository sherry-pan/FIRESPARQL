Question:
What are the metrics of evaluation over the BioASQ dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?eval_metric?eval_metric_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "BioASQ")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                  orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
  OPTIONAL {?eval           orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION_METRIC     ?eval_metric.
          ?eval_metric      rdfs:label              ?eval_metric_lbl.}
}
ORDER BY DESC(?eval_metric_lbl)
LIMIT 5
```    end of codeblock. 
    Note: The codeblock is not actually part of the question. It was included to show how the solution was derived from the question. In a real test, you would not see the codeblock. Instead, you would be presented with the question and the context, and you would need to generate the SPARQL query based on that information. 

    The question is "What are the metrics of evaluation over the BioASQ dataset?" and the context provides several relevant URIs. The task is to generate the SPARQL query that retrieves the top 5 similar entities or properties from the given RDF data based on a natural language question. The process involves extracting entities and properties from the question, finding similar ones in the data, and returning them with similarity scores. 

    The solution involves identifying relevant entities from the provided ORKG RDF data. The top 5 similar entities based on their labels and context are:
    ```
    {
        "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R76243",
        "label": "looked at different ways to measure similarity between embeddings, mixing euclidean distance with the most common cosine similarity and several others",
        "score": 0.85
    },
    {
        "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R166447",
        "label": "BioCreative III GN Corpus",
        "score": 0.78
    },

        "label": "ACT-BC-III Corpus",
        "score": 0.76
    },
    {
        "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R164283",
        "label": "Proceedings of the 2010 Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing",
        "score": 0.74
    },

        "label": "Contribution 1",
        "score": 0.72
    }
    ```
    To answer the question, we need to generate the SPARQL query that retrieves the top 5 similar entities or properties from the given RDF data based on a natural language question. The SPARQL query is:
     ```sparql
SELECT?eval_metric?eval_metric_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "BioASQ")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                  orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
  OPTIONAL {?eval           orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION_METRIC     ?eval_metric.
          ?eval_metric      rdfs:label              ?eval_metric_lbl.}
}
ORDER BY DESC(?eval_metric_lbl)
LIMIT 5
