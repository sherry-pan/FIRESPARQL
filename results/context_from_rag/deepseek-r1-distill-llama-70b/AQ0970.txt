Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the Atari 2600 HERO benchmark dataset. The question is about listing the metrics used, so I'm looking for properties related to evaluation, benchmarks, and performance measurement.

First, I'll go through each property and its label to see if it relates to evaluation or metrics. 

I see properties like "evaluation" with label "evaluation" â€“ that's directly related. Then there's "has benchmark" which is about benchmarks, so that fits. "method" could be relevant because evaluation methods are often used. 

Looking further, "Accuracy", "Recall", "macro-F1", "micro-F1" are all common evaluation metrics. "NDCG@10" is a ranking metric, which might be used in some benchmarks. "Avg Characters", "Avg words", etc., might relate to data characteristics but not directly to evaluation metrics. 

I should focus on the ones that are clearly metrics or related to evaluation processes. So, properties like "evaluation", "has benchmark", "method", "Accuracy", "Recall", "macro-F1", "micro-F1", and "NDCG@10" seem most relevant. Each of these can help in understanding how models are assessed on the dataset.
