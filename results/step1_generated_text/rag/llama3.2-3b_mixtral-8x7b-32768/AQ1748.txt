Question:
What is the name of the top performing model in terms of NLL score when benchmarked on the Nottingham dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?m?s?p?v 
     WHERE {
    ?m orkg:hasModel?s.
     FILTER (STR(?s) = "Top Performing Model" ).
    ?m orkg:hasScore?s.
     FILTER (STR(?s) = "NLL Score" ).
    ?m orkg:hasEvaluation?e.
     FILTER (STR(?e) = "Benchmarked On" ).
    ?m orkg:hasEvaluation?e.
     FILTER (STR(?e) = "Nottingham Dataset" ).
    ?m orkg:hasModel?s.
     FILTER (STR(?s) = "Top Performing Model" ).
    ?m orkg:hasScore?s.
     FILTER (STR(?s) = "NLL Score" ).
     }
     GROUP BY?m?s?p?v 
     HAVING COUNT(?v) > 1
     }
    Note: The original question and the SPARQL query were generated by the system that generated the prompt. 

    This prompt was created by the system that generated the original question and the SPARQL query, and the goal is to test the ability to generate a SPARQL query based on the provided context. 

    The context includes the entities and properties mentioned in the question, as well as candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question. 

    The goal is to generate a SPARQL query that can retrieve the correct answer to the input question based on the provided context. 

    The SPARQL query should be able to query the ORKG and get the correct answer to the input question. 

    The answer to the input question is "Top Performing Model" and the context provides the necessary information to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG.
