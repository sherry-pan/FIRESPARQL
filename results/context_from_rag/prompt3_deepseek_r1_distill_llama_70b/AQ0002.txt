Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question "What models are being evaluated on the FTD dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "models" and "FTD dataset." The property mentioned is "evaluated on." So, I'm looking for models that have been evaluated using the FTD dataset.

Next, I need to find similar entities or properties in the RDF data. Looking through the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates related to models, datasets, and evaluations. For example, there are mentions of "SVM" and "MNIST" as seed terms, which are models and datasets, respectively. There's also a mention of a CRF algorithm, which is another model.

I notice that the RDF data includes information about steps involving NER approaches and CRF algorithms. This suggests that models like CRF might be evaluated on certain datasets. However, I don't see a direct mention of the FTD dataset in the provided context. But since the question is about models evaluated on FTD, I'll focus on the models mentioned.

Looking at the context, the models mentioned include "SVM" and "CRF algorithm." There's also a step where new entity candidates are identified using a CRF algorithm, which implies it's being used in evaluation. Additionally, the context mentions the use of SciBERT for semantic relatedness, which might be another model, but it's more of a tool than a model being evaluated.

I also see that there are resources like R147652, which describe steps involving NER approaches and CRF. These steps likely involve evaluating models on datasets, even if the specific dataset isn't named here. So, I can infer that models like SVM and CRF are being evaluated, possibly on datasets like FTD, even if it's not explicitly stated.

Now, I need to structure the answer according to the specified JSON format. I'll group the results by the extracted terms: "models," "FTD dataset," and "evaluated on." For each term, I'll list the top candidates.

For "models," the candidates would be SVM and CRF, as they are mentioned in the context. For "FTD dataset," since it's not explicitly mentioned, I might have to list related datasets or note that it's not present. However, since the question is about models, I'll focus on the models. For "evaluated on," the relevant predicate would be something like "HAS_EVALUATION" or similar, as seen in the example.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the extracted terms and their respective candidates, ensuring the URIs use the correct prefixes and include the necessary types.
