Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the s that are used to evaluate models on the CommonsenseQA benchmark dataset?" Wait, the question seems a bit cut off. It says "List the s that are used..." Maybe it's supposed to be "List the metrics that are used..." That makes more sense. So, the task is to list the evaluation metrics used for models on the CommonsenseQA benchmark dataset.

First, I need to extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "metrics" and "CommonsenseQA benchmark dataset". The action is "used to evaluate", which implies a relationship between models and the dataset using these metrics.

Looking at the provided context, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there are steps described for a method (R147656) that involve seed terms like SVM and MNIST. There are also resources related to entities like R147244 with a value of 93.9, which might be an accuracy score. Then there are papers with authors and venues, like R147246 and R283710, which are related to publications.

I need to find entities and properties related to evaluation metrics. Metrics could be things like accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, etc. In the context, I see that R147244 has a value of 93.9, which could be an accuracy score. So, that might be a relevant metric.

Next, I need to look for properties that connect models to the dataset. The predicate P39020 in the context describes steps, but I'm not sure if that's directly relevant. There's also P27, which seems to denote authors, and P28 and p29, which are about years and possibly other counts.

Wait, in the second part of the context, there's a resource R283709 which is a journal article. It has predicates like P5044 as "Journal Article", P41924 as "scholarly domain", and P97003 as "entity extraction". It also lists methods like "Graph analytics", "Horizon 2020", "Keyphrase extraction", etc. But I'm not sure if that directly relates to evaluation metrics.

I think I need to focus on resources that are datasets and their associated metrics. The CommonsenseQA dataset isn't explicitly mentioned in the context, but maybe there's a similar benchmark. For example, R147244 has a value of 93.9, which could be a metric like accuracy. So, perhaps that's a candidate.

I also see that R283709 mentions "Natural language processing" and "Text mining", which might be related to how models are evaluated on datasets. But I'm not sure how that ties into specific metrics.

Since the context doesn't explicitly mention CommonsenseQA, I might have to infer based on similar datasets. For example, if there's a dataset like MNIST mentioned, which is a benchmark, the metrics used there could be similar to what's used for CommonsenseQA.

Looking back, the steps in R147656 talk about using a CRF algorithm and filtering entity candidates, which might relate to model evaluation. The accuracy value in R147244 could be one of the metrics.

So, putting it together, the extracted terms are "metrics" and "CommonsenseQA benchmark dataset". The candidates would include any resources that represent metrics, like R147244 with 93.9, and any properties that link models to datasets for evaluation, like P39020 which describes steps involving evaluation.

I think the top candidates would be the resources and properties that are related to evaluation processes and metrics. Even though the exact dataset isn't in the context, the method steps and the metrics like accuracy are relevant.
