Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. The question is asking where to find code references in papers that used the BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo model for benchmarking. 

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The main entities here are "code references," "papers," and the specific model "BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo." The action is "used for benchmarking purposes."

Looking at the context data, I see that there are two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a method involving several steps using techniques like SVM and MNIST as seed terms. It also mentions using SciBERT and k-means for expansion. R284316 is a journal article about extracting entity knowledge using models like jpark, which involves NER and EL tools, and it's evaluated on datasets like AIDA and MEANTIME.

I need to find entities related to code references, papers, and the model. In the data, R284316 is a journal article that uses various models and tools. It mentions URLs and DOIs, which could be where code is referenced. The model mentioned is jpark, which is different from BiDAF, but it's related to NER and entity linking, which might be connected.

Since the exact model isn't in the data, I'll look for similar models or papers that discuss benchmarking. R284316's URL is "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075," which could be a source. Also, the authors and venue might provide clues about where code is hosted.

For code references, the URL and DOI are the primary sources. The model used in R284316 is jpark, which is a probabilistic model for entity annotations. Although it's not BiDAF, it's related to NLP tasks and might have code available through the paper's references or supplementary materials.

So, the top candidates would include the journal article R284316 and its associated URL and DOI. The model jpark, while different, is the closest match in the data. The authors and venue might also have their own code repositories linked elsewhere, but based on the provided data, the main reference is the DOI URL.

I'll structure the answer to include the extracted terms and the top candidates, ensuring the JSON format is correct with appropriate URIs and types.
