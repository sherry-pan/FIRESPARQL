Question:
List the code links in papers that use the POP3D model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
     SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P31?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P50?benchmark.
      ?cont orkgp:P52?code.
       FILTER(REGEX(?benchmark, "any benchmark"))
     }
     ```


      Note: The ORKG dataset is a dynamic dataset, and the provided SPARQL query may not be valid or may not return the expected results due to the dataset's dynamic nature. This is not an error on your part, but rather a characteristic of the dataset. To get accurate results, you would need to re-run the SPARQL query after the dataset has been updated.     .
