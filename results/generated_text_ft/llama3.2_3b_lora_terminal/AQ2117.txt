Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the SRU++ Base model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?model        a            orkgc:Model;
                   rdfs:label      ?model_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "SRU++ Base")
