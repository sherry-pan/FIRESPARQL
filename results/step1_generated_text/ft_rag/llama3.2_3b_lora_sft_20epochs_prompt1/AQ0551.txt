Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Dmlab-30 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
        FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Dmlab-30")
       ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                        orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION      ?eval.
       ?eval           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark;
                        orkgp:HAS_METHOD        ?method.
       ?cont         orkgp:HAS_IMPLEMENTATION  ?implementation.
       ?paper        orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
        SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
        WHERE {
          ?paper        a                orkgp:P31                ;
                     rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
         }<|eot_id|>
