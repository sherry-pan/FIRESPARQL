Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model rdfs:label?modelLabel.
 ?model a?modelType.
 ?dataset a?datasetType.
 ?model?testedOn?dataset.
 ?dataset rdfs:label?datasetLabel.
  FILTER (STR(?datasetLabel) = "Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std benchmark dataset" || STR(?modelLabel) = "SVM" || STR(?modelLabel) = "SciBERT" || STR(?modelLabel) = "k-means")
}
``` 
    Note: The above SPARQL query is generated based on the provided input question, context, and extracted terms. It is intended to retrieve the correct answer to the input question from the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). However, the actual query may need to be adjusted based on the specific RDF data structure and the exact requirements of the ORKG.<|eot_id|>
