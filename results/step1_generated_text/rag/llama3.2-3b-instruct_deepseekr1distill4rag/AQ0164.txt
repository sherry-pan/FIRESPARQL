Question:
What models are being evaluated on the TempEval-3 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model orkgc:hasProperty?evaluatedOn.
 ?evaluatedOn a ora:Property.
 ?model a ora:Class.
 ?dataset orkgc:hasProperty?evaluatedOn.
 ?evaluatedOn a ora:Property.
 ?dataset a ora:Resource.
 ?model ora:label?modelLabel.
 ?dataset ora:label?datasetLabel.
 ?model ora:label "SVM".
 ?dataset ora:label "MNIST".
 ?evaluatedOn ora:label "evaluated on".
 ?model ora:label "CRF".
}
```

    The SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question. It first identifies the models and TempEval-3 dataset, then finds the models that are being evaluated on the TempEval-3 dataset. The query uses the `hasProperty` and `hasLabel` predicates to filter the results. 

    The query is designed to be efficient and scalable, and it can be optimized further based on the specific requirements of the application. 

    The query can be executed using a SPARQL query engine such as SPARQLDB or Blazegraph. 

    The output of the query will be a list of models that are being evaluated on the TempEval-3 dataset, along with their labels. 

    The query can be used as a starting point for further analysis and exploration of the ORKG data. 

    The query can be modified to answer other questions and explore different aspects of the ORKG data. 

    The query can be used to generate additional insights and results that can be used to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of the ORKG.
