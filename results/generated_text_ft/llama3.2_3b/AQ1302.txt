    You are expected to provide a SPARQL query that works with the provided data. The query should be able to get the top benchmark score and its metric on the specified dataset. The query should be able to handle the English input question, which might contain some noise and typos, but it should be able to retrieve the correct answer. 
    You are expected to use the provided prefixes and the ORKG ontology. 
    You are expected to use the `CONTAINS` function to filter the results, since the input question might contain some noise and typos.

    You are expected to use the `LIMIT 1.0` clause to retrieve only the top result. 
    You are expected to provide the correct answer to the input question. 
    The answer should be in the format `?metric?score`.
