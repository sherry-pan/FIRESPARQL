Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Which model has achieved the highest Percentage error score on the SVHN benchmark dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "model" and "SVHN benchmark dataset". The property mentioned is "Percentage error score".

Looking through the context, I see that there are several resources related to models and datasets. For example, R147652 describes a method involving SVM and MNIST, which might be relevant. There's also information about steps involving NER approaches and CRF algorithms, which could relate to models.

I notice that R283709 and R283710 mention various entities like "Graph analytics", "Horizon 2020", and specific models or methods like "Keyphrase extraction" and "Named entity recognition". These could be related to the models in question.

Since the question is about the SVHN dataset and percentage error, I'll look for any mentions of SVHN or similar benchmarks. However, in the provided context, I don't see explicit mentions of SVHN. But there are mentions of MNIST, which is another benchmark dataset, so maybe the models used for MNIST could be relevant.

I'll consider the models mentioned, such as SVM, and see if they have any associated error scores. R147244 has a value of "93.9", which might be an error score, but it's not clear if it's related to SVHN.

Since the context doesn't directly mention SVHN, I'll have to infer based on similar datasets. The models mentioned, like those using SciBERT and k-means, might be candidates. Also, the authors associated with some resources, like Ligia Sierra or Yuanyuan Wu, might have worked on models applicable to SVHN.

I'll structure the answer by extracting the terms "model", "SVHN benchmark dataset", and "Percentage error score". Then, I'll look for the top candidates in the context. Even though SVHN isn't explicitly mentioned, I'll include the closest related entities and properties from the data.

Finally, I'll format the JSON output with the extracted terms and the top candidates, ensuring the correct RDF prefixes are used for URIs and types.
