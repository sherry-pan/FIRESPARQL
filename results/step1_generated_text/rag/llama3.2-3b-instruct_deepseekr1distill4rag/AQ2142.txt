Question:
List the code links in papers that use the 12-layer Transformer-XL model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>

    SELECT?paper?code_link
    WHERE {
     ?paper orkgc:has_code_link?code_link.
     ?paper orkgp:uses?model.
     ?model orkgc:is_a?model_type.
     ?model_type orkgc:has_name "Transformer-XL".
     ?paper orkgp:has_benchmark?benchmark.
     ?benchmark orkgc:has_name "benchmark_name".
     ?paper orkgr:R284317
    }
    ``` 
    If you want to get the correct answer, you should make sure that the SPARQL query is correct. The correct answer should be the list of code links in papers that use the 12-layer Transformer-XL model in any benchmark. 

    Note that the SPARQL query is based on the provided JSON output and the context data. The actual answer may vary depending on the actual data in the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question. However, the query may not cover all possible cases, and the answer may not be exhaustive. 

    Please verify the correctness of the SPARQL query and the answer based on the actual data in the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Also, note that the SPARQL query is just a suggestion and may need to be modified based on the actual data and the specific requirements of the task. 

    The SPARQL query is not a direct copy of the JSON output, but rather a representation of the query that can be executed on the ORKG.
