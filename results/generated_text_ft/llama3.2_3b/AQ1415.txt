    note: This query is based on the assumption that the best model is the one with the highest F1-score. If the best model is defined by another metric, you need to adjust the query accordingly.
    note: The model, benchmark, metric, and F1-score are represented as resources in the knowledge graph. The query assumes that the relevant resources are linked to each other via the described properties. 
    note: The query uses the FILTER function to filter out the results that do not match the desired metric and F1-score description. 
    note: The query uses the GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses to retrieve the top-scoring model. 
    note: The LIMIT and OFFSET clauses are used to retrieve the top-scoring model.
