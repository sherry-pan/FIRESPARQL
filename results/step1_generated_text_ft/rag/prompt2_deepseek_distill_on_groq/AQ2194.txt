Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Adaptive Input Large model and include the links to their code?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "papers" and "Adaptive Input Large model." The action or property is "utilized," which relates papers to the model. Also, the question asks for "links to their code," so I need to consider properties related to URLs or code repositories.

Looking at the context information, I see two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 seems to describe a method involving steps for named entity recognition, using tools like SciBERT and CRF algorithms. R284316, on the other hand, is about a journal article titled "validation research" and "technique," published in 2021, with authors like Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta. It also has a URL link to a DOI.

Now, I need to compute the similarity between the extracted terms and the entities in the RDF data. The term "papers" would correspond to resources of type "Journal Article" or similar. "Adaptive Input Large model" isn't directly mentioned, but R284316 discusses techniques and models, so it might be related. The URL in R284317 is a DOI link, which could be considered as a code link, though it's actually a paper link.

Next, I'll select the top candidates. For "papers," R284316 is a journal article, so it's a good match. For "Adaptive Input Large model," since it's not explicitly mentioned, I'll look for related models or techniques. R284316's title mentions "validation research" and "technique," which might be related. The URL in R284317 is the DOI, which is the closest to a code link, though it's a paper URL.

I also need to structure the JSON output correctly, using the appropriate RDF prefixes and including types. Each candidate should have a URI, label, score, type, and RDF type.

Putting it all together, the JSON should list the extracted terms and their top candidates, ensuring that the structure matches the example provided. I'll make sure to use the correct prefixes like "orkgr:" for resources and "orkgp:" for properties, and include "rdfs:label" for each entity.

I think that's about it. I'll format the JSON accordingly, making sure the scores are reasonable and the types are correctly assigned.
