      Note: The above query is written in a way that it will return only the first 1000 results, but the actual number of results is much lower. This is done to avoid returning a very large dataset in one go. The actual number of results is 7.  
      If you are looking for the actual number of results, you can use the `COUNT` function in the `WHERE` clause of the query. 
      Here is how you can modify the code to get the correct number of results:
