Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WMT2016 English-Romanian dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "research paper titles," "IDs," "benchmarked models," and the specific dataset "WMT2016 English-Romanian." The properties involved would be things like "benchmarked on" or "has dataset."

Looking at the context data, I see two main resources: R147652 and R284316, along with R284317. R147652 seems to describe a method involving steps for named entity recognition, using datasets like MNIST and models like SVM. R284316 talks about a journal article focused on extracting entity knowledge using various tools and datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP. R284317 is another paper with authors and a DOI.

I need to find which of these papers mention benchmarking on the WMT2016 English-Romanian dataset. However, scanning through the context, I don't see any direct mention of WMT2016 or English-Romanian. The datasets mentioned are AIDA, MEANTIME, TAC-KBP, and MNIST. 

Since there's no explicit mention of WMT2016, I might have to infer or see if any of the papers could be related. R284316's paper is about entity recognition and linking, which might be relevant to machine translation tasks, but without explicit mention, it's a stretch. R147652's method uses MNIST, which is an image dataset, so it's less likely related.

Given the lack of direct information, I might have to conclude that there are no papers in the provided data that benchmarked models on WMT2016 English-Romanian. Alternatively, if I have to select the most similar, R284316 is the closest as it deals with NLP tasks, even though the dataset doesn't match.

So, the answer would be that there are no matching papers based on the provided data. If forced to pick, R284316 might be the closest, but it's not a perfect match.

Based on the provided context, there are no research papers that explicitly mention benchmarking models on the WMT2016 English-Romanian dataset. However, the closest related paper is R284316, which discusses entity recognition and linking, though it uses different datasets.
