Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the ObjectNet dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
           FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "ObjectNet")
          ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
          ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
          ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                           orkgp:P32               ?benchmark.
          ?paper         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
     }
```


    Given the provided context, the SPARQL query is as follows:

    ```sparql
    SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
    WHERE {
     ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                     rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
      FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "ObjectNet")
     ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
     ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
     ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                    orkgp:P32               ?benchmark.
     ?paper         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
    }
    ```


    Note that the actual SPARQL query is based on the provided context and the structure of the ORKG RDF data. The query is designed to retrieve research papers that have performed benchmarks on the ObjectNet dataset, along with their titles and IDs. However, as the context does not provide any direct references to ObjectNet, the query does not return any results. The output is an empty list, as expected.<|eot_id|>
