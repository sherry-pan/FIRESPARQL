    Note: The model that performed best in terms of Macro Recall metric on the NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only) benchmark dataset is BERT. 
    This is because the SPARQL query is designed to find the model that has the best Macro Recall metric on the specified dataset, 
    and the label of that model is "BERT".
