Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the DuIE dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
           FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "DuIE")
          ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
          ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
          ?eval         orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION     ?cont;
                        orkgp:P31               ?model.
          ?model      rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
     }    


    Note: The above SPARQL query is generated from the given input question and context. The query is to be executed on the ORKG to get the answer to the input question. 

    The query is based on the following logic:
    1. First, we filter the datasets to only include the DuIE dataset.
    2. Then, we find the benchmarks that have been performed on the filtered dataset.
    3. Next, we find the evaluations that have been performed on the filtered benchmarks.
    4. After that, we find the models that have been evaluated on the filtered evaluations.
    5. Finally, we return the labels of the models.

    The query uses the following properties and entities from the ORKG:
    - orkgc:Dataset (entity)
    - orkgp:HAS_DATASET (property)
    - orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK (property)
    - orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION (property)
    - orkgp:P31 (property)
    - orkgp:HAS_MODEL (property)
    - orkgp:HAS_MODEL (property)
    - rdfs:label (property)
    - orkgc:Resource (class)
    - orkgc:Dataset (class)
    - orkgp:HAS_DATASET (property)
    - orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK (property)
    - orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION (property)
    - orkgp:P31 (property)
    - orkgp:HAS_MODEL (property)
    - rdfs:label (property) 

    The query is designed to be executed on the ORKG to get the correct answer to the input question. 

    Note that the SPARQL query is generated based on the given context and the logic described above. The query is to be executed on the ORKG to get the correct answer to the input question. 

    Please note that the SPARQL query is based on the assumptions and inferences made from the context provided. The query may not work as expected if the assumptions and inferences are incorrect or incomplete.
