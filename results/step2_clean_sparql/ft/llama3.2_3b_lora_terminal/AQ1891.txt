```sparql
SELECT ?dataset ?dataset_lbl
WHERE {
  ?paper a orkgc:Source;
         rdfs:label "paperscope";
         orkgp:P34 ?research_area.
  ?research_area orkgp:P43 ?field.
  ?field rdfs:label "entity disambiguation".
  
  ?dataset orkgp:P38 ?paper;
           rdfs:label ?dataset_lbl.
}
```

Note: The above query assumes `paperscope` is a specific label indicating papers related to this investigation and `entity disambiguation` as the particular research field label. Adjust "paperscope" and "entity disambiguation" with actual known labels if different in the dataset. The query is simplified significantly to directly address retrieving datasets used in the entity disambiguation research area without repetitive or generic elements.
