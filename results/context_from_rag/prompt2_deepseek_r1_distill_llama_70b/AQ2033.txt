Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking to list the code links in papers that use the Unsupervised NMT + weight-sharing model in any benchmark. 

First, I'll break down the query to extract the relevant terms. The main entities here are "Unsupervised NMT + weight-sharing model" and "code links." The property is "used in benchmark."

Looking at the context, I see that there are two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a method involving several steps, including using SciBERT and k-means for expansion, applying a CRF algorithm, and filtering candidates. R284316 is a journal article about extracting entity knowledge using a model called jpark, which involves NER and EL tools, and it's evaluated on datasets like AIDA and MEANTIME.

I need to find if any of these resources mention the Unsupervised NMT + weight-sharing model. R147652 doesn't seem to mention NMT or weight-sharing. R284316 talks about NLP tasks but not specifically about NMT or weight-sharing models. 

Since the context doesn't provide information about the Unsupervised NMT + weight-sharing model or code links, I can't find any relevant candidates. Therefore, the candidates for each extracted term will be empty.
