Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the MultiRC dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?e?m
WHERE {
 ?e a ora:EvaluationMetric.
 ?e rdfs:label?l.
 ?m a ora:Model.
 ?m ora:hasEvaluation?e.
 ?m ora:hasPerformance?p.
 ?m ora:hasScore?s.
  FILTER (str(?l) = "F1-score" OR str(?l) = "Precision" OR str(?l) = "Recall" OR str(?l) = "Accuracy")
  FILTER (str(?s) = "Accuracy")
}
``` 

    The final answer is not an explicit number, but a SPARQL query. 

    Note: The provided SPARQL query assumes that the entities and properties in the ORKG are linked with the same labels as mentioned in the question. The actual query might need to be adjusted based on the actual labels in the ORKG. 

    Also, please note that the query only returns the evaluation metrics that are commonly used when benchmarking models on the MultiRC dataset, which are F1-score, Precision, Recall, and Accuracy. 

    The query uses the following predicates from the ORKG:
    - `ora:EvaluationMetric` for entities that represent evaluation metrics.
    - `ora:Model` for entities that represent models.
    - `ora:hasEvaluation` for the relationships between models and evaluation metrics.
    - `ora:hasPerformance` for the relationships between models and performance metrics.
    - `ora:hasScore` for the relationships between models and scores.
    - `ora:hasMetric` for the relationships between models and evaluation metrics.
    - `ora:label` for the labels of entities.
    - `ora:hasPerformance` for the relationships between models and performance metrics. 

    The query also uses the `str()` function to filter the labels and scores based on their string values.
