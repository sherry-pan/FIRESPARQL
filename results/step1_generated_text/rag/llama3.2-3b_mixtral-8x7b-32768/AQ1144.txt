Question:
What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset CommonsenseQA?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT?metric?value
WHERE {
 ?dataset a orkgc:Dataset.
 ?dataset orkgc:datasetName "CommonsenseQA".
 ?result a orkgp:Result.
 ?result orkgp:dataset?dataset.
 ?result orkgp:metric?metric.
 ?result orkgp:value?value.
  FILTER (STR(?metric) = "F1 score")
  FILTER (STR(?value) = "0.8")
}
```
