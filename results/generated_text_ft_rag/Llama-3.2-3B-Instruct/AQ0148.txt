Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the QNLI benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "QNLI benchmark dataset")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?model         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                  rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
}
ORDER BY (ASC?model_lbl)
LIMIT 5;
```    ``` 
    Note: The SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG RDF data dump. The query retrieves the top 5 models tested on the QNLI benchmark dataset. The `SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl` statement selects the distinct model URIs and labels. The `WHERE` clause filters the data to include only the models tested on the specified dataset. The `FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "QNLI benchmark dataset")` statement ensures that only the dataset with the specified label is included. The `?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.` and `?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.` statements retrieve the benchmarks and contributions associated with the dataset. The `?model         orkgp:P31               ?cont;` and `rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.` statements retrieve the models and their labels. The `ORDER BY (ASC?model_lbl)` statement sorts the results in ascending order based on the model labels, and the `LIMIT 5` statement limits the output to the top 5 models.<|eot_id|>
