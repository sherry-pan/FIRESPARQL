Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the ART/CoreSC benchmark dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The question mentions "metrics," "models," and "ART/CoreSC benchmark dataset." So, the key entities here are "metrics," "models," and "ART/CoreSC benchmark dataset." The property being discussed is "evaluate," which relates models to the dataset using specific metrics.

Next, I need to compute the similarity between these terms and the entities in the RDF data. Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a method with several steps, and R284316 talks about a research article on entity knowledge extraction. 

I'll focus on the terms related to evaluation. In the context, I see mentions of "validation research" and "technique" which might relate to evaluation methods. Also, there are resources like R147652 which has steps involving NER approaches and CRF algorithms, which could be related to models and their evaluation.

For "ART/CoreSC benchmark dataset," I don't see a direct mention, but perhaps "MNIST" is a similar dataset. Since the context includes "MNIST" as a seed term, maybe that's a close match. 

Now, I'll look for metrics. The context doesn't explicitly list metrics, but in the research article (R284316), they mention evaluation using different datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP. These could be related to metrics or benchmarking. 

I'll also consider the authors and venues as possible related entities, but they might not be directly relevant to the metrics themselves. 

Putting this together, I'll map the extracted terms to the closest entities in the RDF data. "ART/CoreSC benchmark dataset" might correspond to "MNIST" as a similar dataset. "Models" could relate to resources like "SVM" mentioned in the context. "Metrics" might be linked to the evaluation methods described in the research articles, such as those using AIDA or MEANTIME datasets.

I'll assign similarity scores based on how closely each term matches. For example, "MNIST" would have a high score for the dataset, "SVM" for models, and the research articles for metrics. 

Finally, I'll structure the JSON output, grouping the candidates under each extracted term with their respective scores and types.
