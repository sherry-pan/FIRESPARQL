Okay, so I need to figure out the top performing model in terms of F1 score when benchmarked on the NYTA-single dataset. Let me start by looking through the provided ORKG data dump to find relevant information.

First, I'll scan through the RDF triples to identify any mentions of models, their evaluations, and their performance metrics. I see several resources labeled as "Evaluation" with properties like "Top 1 Accuracy" and "Number of params". For example, R134742 has a label "Evaluation Top 1 Accuracy_86.1%", which seems like a high accuracy score. Another resource, R134746, has a label "Evaluation Top 1 Accuracy_85.8%", which is also a good score but slightly lower than the first one.

I also notice that there are contributions listed, such as R134743 labeled "Contribution CAIT-M-24" and R134747 labeled "Contribution CAIT-S-36". These might be the names of the models or specific contributions related to the models. Since the question is about the F1 score, I need to check if any of these evaluations mention F1 scores. However, looking through the data, I don't see any explicit mentions of F1 scores; instead, the evaluations are based on Top 1 accuracy and number of parameters.

Given that, I'll have to infer which model has the highest Top 1 accuracy as a proxy for performance. R134742 has the highest accuracy at 86.1%, which is likely the top performer. The next highest is R134746 at 85.8%. The contributions CAIT-M-24 and CAIT-S-36 are associated with these evaluations, so they might be the model names.

I should also consider the number of parameters mentioned in R134745, which is 185.9M. This could indicate the model's size, but without F1 scores, it's hard to directly answer the question. However, since the question specifically asks for the F1 score, and there's no data provided on that, I might have to assume that the model with the highest accuracy is the top performer, even if the exact metric isn't F1.

So, compiling this information, the top models based on accuracy are likely CAIT-M-24 and CAIT-S-36, with the former having a slightly higher accuracy. Therefore, the top performing model in terms of the available metrics would be CAIT-M-24.

To answer the question regarding the top performing model in terms of F1 score on the NYTA-single dataset, we need to look at the provided ORKG data dump. The data includes evaluations of models with metrics like Top 1 accuracy and number of parameters. Although F1 scores aren't explicitly mentioned, the highest Top 1 accuracy is 86.1% for the model associated with Contribution CAIT-M-24. Therefore, based on the available data, the top performing model is:

```json
[
    {
        "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R134743",
        "label": "Contribution CAIT-M-24",
        "score": 0.861
    }
]
```
