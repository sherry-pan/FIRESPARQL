Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the AAPD dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/predicate/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/predicate/ontology/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/resource/>

SELECT?paper?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper a orkp:PAPER.
 ?paper orkp:HAS_ID?id.
 ?paper orkp:HAS_TITLE?title.
 ?paper orkp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkp:HAS_AAPD?dataset.
 ?dataset a orkgr:RESOURCE.
 ?dataset orkgr:label "AAPD".
}
``` 
    Note: The SPARQL query is generated based on the provided input question and context. The query is not manually crafted but automatically generated based on the provided information. 

    The SPARQL query uses the following predicates:
    - `orkp:PAPER`: represents a research paper.
    - `orkp:HAS_ID`: represents that a research paper has an ID.
    - `orkp:HAS_TITLE`: represents that a research paper has a title.
    - `orkp:HAS_BENCHMARK`: represents that a research paper has performed benchmarks.
    - `orkgp:HAS_AAPD`: represents that a benchmark has the AAPD dataset.
    - `orkgr:RESOURCE`: represents a resource.
    - `orkgr:label`: represents the label of a resource.

    The query works as follows:
    1. It selects the `paper` variable to represent a research paper.
    2. It filters the `paper` variable to only include papers that are instances of `orkp:PAPER`.
    3. It filters the `paper` variable to only include papers that have an `id` property (i.e., `orkp:HAS_ID?id`).
    4. It filters the `paper` variable to only include papers that have a `title` property (i.e., `orkp:HAS_TITLE?title`).
    5. It filters the `paper` variable to only include papers that have a `benchmark` property (i.e., `orkp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark`).
    6. It filters the `benchmark` variable to only include benchmarks that have an `AAPD` dataset (i.e., `orkgp:HAS_AAPD?dataset`).
    7. It filters the `dataset` variable to only include datasets that are instances of `orkgr:RESOURCE`.
    8. It filters the `dataset` variable to only include datasets with the label "AAPD
