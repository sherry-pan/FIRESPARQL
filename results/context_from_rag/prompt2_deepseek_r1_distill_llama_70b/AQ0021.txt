Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question "What models are being evaluated on the TDMSci dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "models" and "TDMSci dataset". The property implied is "evaluated on". So, I'll note these as the extracted terms.

Next, I need to compute the similarity between these terms and the entities in the RDF data. Looking at the context, I see mentions of SVM, MNIST, CRF, SciBERT, and other models. The TDMSci dataset isn't directly mentioned, but MNIST is a well-known dataset, so it might be a close match.

For "models", the context talks about SVM, CRF, and SciBERT. These are specific models, so they should be the top candidates. "Evaluated on" relates to how models are assessed, so I'll look for terms like "validation" or "evaluation" in the data. The context has "validation research" and "evaluation", which fit here.

Now, I'll structure the JSON output. I'll group the results by each extracted term and list the top 5 candidates with their scores. Since TDMSci isn't in the data, I'll use MNIST as a substitute. For models, I'll include SVM, CRF, SciBERT, and others mentioned. For "evaluated on", I'll use terms like "validation" and "evaluation".

I need to make sure the URIs use the correct prefixes and that each entry has the right type and RDF type. I'll also ensure the scores reflect how relevant each candidate is to the extracted term.

Finally, I'll format everything into the specified JSON structure, making sure each part is correctly labeled and the scores are appropriate. This should provide a clear and relevant answer to the question based on the given context.
