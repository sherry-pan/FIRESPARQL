Question:
What is the name of the top performing model in terms of Number of params score when benchmarked on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?score 
WHERE {
 ?model rdfs:label?modelLabel.
 ?model orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark rdfs:label?benchmarkLabel.
 ?benchmark orkg:dataset?dataset.
 ?dataset a orkg:Dataset.
 ?dataset orkg:datasetName "Penn Treebank (Character Level)".
 ?benchmark orkg:score?score.
  FILTER (?score > 0.7).
 ?model orkg:hasValue?value.
 ?value orkg:property?property.
 ?property orkg:propertyURI "http://example.org/numberOfParamsScore".
 ?value orkg:value "top performing".
 ?model orkg:label?modelLabel.
 ?model orkg:type "Model".
  FILTER (STR(?modelLabel) = "SVM" OR STR(?modelLabel) = "Flair NER").
}

    Note: The SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context and the question. It's possible that the query might not be optimal or might not return the correct results due to the limitations of the provided data. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to find the top-performing model in terms of the number of parameters score when benchmarked on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset. It first filters the models based on their labels and then checks if they have a benchmark with a score greater than 0.7. The query then filters the models based on their type and label, and finally returns the model and its score.
