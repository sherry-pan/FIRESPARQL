Question:
What quantity of iron oxide was discovered on Elorza crater?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?s?p?o 
     WHERE {
    ?s?p?o.
     filter (str(?s) = "Elorza crater" || str(?o) = "Elorza crater").
     filter (str(?p) = "quantity of iron oxide").
     } 
    Note: The provided SPARQL query is not correct. It should be modified to include the correct candidates for the entities and properties mentioned in the question. 

    Here is a corrected SPARQ query:
    SELECT?s?p?o 
    WHERE {
    ?s?p?o.
     filter (str(?s) = "Elorza crater" || str(?o) = "Elorza crater").
     filter (str(?p) = "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36053" || str(?p) = "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36054").
     filter (str(?o) = "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36053" || str(?o) = "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36054").
     }
    Note: This query is still not correct. It is missing the quantity of iron oxide entity. To include it, we need to use the candidate property for quantity of iron oxide, which is "quantity of iron oxide". We also need to filter the candidates to only include the ones related to iron oxide. 

    Here is the corrected SPARQL query:
    SELECT?s?p?o 
    WHERE {
    ?s?p?o.
     filter (str(?s) = "Elorza crater" || str(?o) = "Elorza crater").
     filter (str(?p) = "quantity of iron oxide").
    ?s a?p1.
     filter (str(?p1) = "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36053" || str(?p1) = "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36054").
     filter (str(?o) = "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36053" || str(?o) = "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36054").
     }
    Note: The query is still not correct. It is missing the quantity of iron oxide entity. To include it, we need to add a filter to include the quantity of iron oxide entity. 

    Here is the corrected SPARQL query:
    SELECT?s?p?o 
    WHERE {
    ?s?p?o.
     filter (str(?
