Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this question using the given context. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the BiT-S (ResNet) model and include links to their code. 

First, I should look through the provided ORKG RDF data to find any mentions of papers or contributions related to the BiT-S model. I'll go through each resource and see if any of them are about BiT-S or ResNet.

Looking at the first file, I see resources like R76234 labeled "BabelEnconding" and R76243 which talks about measuring similarity between embeddings. R76244 is "Team 2 Subtask 1 English" and R75430 is a venue called "IBM Journal of Research and Development". R75431 is "Contribution 1". R75840 is about decision-making in humanitarian response, and R75841 is a paper but the label isn't provided.

In the second file, R163201 is a comparison about Wikipedia-based NER. R162991 is a paper titled "Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study" published in proceedings from 2011. R162992 is the venue for that paper. R162993 is another "Contribution 1". R163369 is labeled "Entity", and R163375 and R163376 are about "Core entity/Event". R163378 is another resource but no label is given.

I don't see any direct mentions of BiT-S or ResNet models in these resources. The papers are about NER, embeddings, and decision-making, but not specifically about BiT-S. Since there's no relevant information, the top similar entities would be none. Therefore, the JSON result is an empty list.

The query seeks papers using the BiT-S (ResNet) model with code links, but the provided context doesn't mention BiT-S or ResNet. Thus, no relevant entities are found.
