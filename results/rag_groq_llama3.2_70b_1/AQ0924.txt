To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined:

1. **Extract entities and properties from the question**: The question mentions "metrics of evaluation" and "Atari 2600 Double Dunk dataset". However, since the provided RDF data dump does not contain any information related to "Atari 2600 Double Dunk dataset", we will focus on "metrics of evaluation" which can be related to "Evaluation" entities.

2. **Retrieve similar entities or properties based on cosine similarity scores**: Since the provided data does not directly relate to the question, we'll look for entities labeled as "Evaluation" which might contain metrics.

3. **Return the top similar entities or properties**: Given the nature of the question and the data provided, we will look for entities that are classified as "Evaluation" and have labels that might imply metrics, even though none directly relate to "Atari 2600 Double Dunk dataset".

Based on the provided RDF data dump, entities related to "Evaluation" are:
- `<http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R134745>` labeled as "Evaluation Number of params_185.9M"
- `<http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R134746>` labeled as "Evaluation Top 1 Accuracy_85.8%"
- `<http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R135036>` labeled as "Evaluation Accuracy_82.1%"
- `<http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R135037>` labeled as "Evaluation Params_5M"
- `<http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R134742>` labeled as "Evaluation Top 1 Accuracy_86.1%"
- `<http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R135039>` labeled as "Evaluation" (without specific metrics mentioned in the label)

Since none of these directly relate to "Atari 2600 Double Dunk dataset" and given the constraint of the task, we will calculate a simple similarity score based on the presence of "Evaluation" and any metric-like terms in their labels. However, due to the nature of the task and the data provided, a true cosine similarity calculation as requested is not feasible without additional context or a method to vectorize the question and entity labels for comparison.

Thus, based on the entities provided and the requirement for a JSON output, a simplified response focusing on entities related to "Evaluation" could be:

```json
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R134742",
    "label": "Evaluation Top 1 Accuracy_86.1%",
    "score": 0.8
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R134745",
    "label": "Evaluation Number of params_185.9M",
    "score": 0.7
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R134746",
    "label": "Evaluation Top 1 Accuracy_85.8%",
    "score": 0.8
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R135036",
    "label": "Evaluation Accuracy_82.1%",
    "score": 0.7
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R135037",
    "label": "Evaluation Params_5M",
    "score": 0.6
  }
]
```

Note: The "score" values are arbitrary and used for demonstration purposes, as the actual calculation of cosine similarity would require vector representations of the question and the entity labels, which is not provided in the context of this task.
