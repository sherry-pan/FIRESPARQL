Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Concept Mention Extraction model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?paper?codeReference
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:HAS_IMPLEMENTATION?implementation.
    ?implementation orkg:HAS_CODE_REFERENCE?codeReference.
     FILTER (STRLIKE(?benchmark, "Concept Mention Extraction") && 
            STRLIKE(?benchmark, "benchmarking"))
     }<|eot_id|>
