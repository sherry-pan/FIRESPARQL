Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Quasart-T benchmark dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "metrics" and "Quasart-T benchmark dataset". The property is "evaluate models on".

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a research method with steps, and R284316 talks about a journal article on entity knowledge extraction. However, I don't see any direct mention of "Quasart-T" or specific metrics used for evaluation.

Since the context doesn't provide information about the Quasart-T dataset or the metrics used, I can't extract any specific entities or properties related to the question. Therefore, the candidates for both "metrics" and "Quasart-T benchmark dataset" will be empty.

```json

      "rdf:type": "orkgp:Predicate"
    }
  ],
  "candidates": {
    "metrics": [],
    "Quasart-T benchmark dataset": [],
    "evaluate models on": []
  }
