Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Adaptive Input Large model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?code
WHERE {
 ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
            rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "Adaptive Input Large")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                  orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
}
```    end of code block

    Note: The provided code block is a complete code block and does not need to be split into multiple lines. 

Here is the code to generate the SPARQL query:

```sql
SELECT?code
WHERE {
 ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
            rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "Adaptive Input Large")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                  orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
}
```

This code will generate a SPARQL query that retrieves the source code for papers that utilize the Adaptive Input Large model. However, since the provided context does not mention the Adaptive Input Large model, this query will not return any results. 

To modify the query to retrieve papers that utilize similar models, you can replace the `FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "Adaptive Input Large")` line with a more general filter, such as `?model_lbl    rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.`, which will retrieve all papers that mention the model in their title. 

Here is the modified query:

```sql
SELECT?code
WHERE {
 ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
            rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
 ?model_lbl    rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                  orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
}
```

This query will retrieve papers that utilize similar models, but since the provided context does not mention the Adaptive Input Large model, it will still not return any results. 

To get the desired results, you would need more context or data about the Adaptive Input Large model and its usage in papers. 

Note that the above query assumes that the model's label is the same as the model's URI. If this is not the case, you may need to modify the query accordingly. 

Also, note that the above query is a simplified example and may not be suitable for production use without further modifications and optimizations. 

In a real-world scenario, you would need to consider factors such as performance, scalability, and data quality when designing and optimizing your SPARQL queries. 

In this case, since the question asks for papers that have utilized the Adaptive Input Large model and include the links to their code, the query should be modified to filter the results based on the model's name. However, since the model's name is not provided in the question, the query will not return any results.

 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
