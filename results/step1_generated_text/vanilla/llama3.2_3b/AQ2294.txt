    END;    ```I'm happy to help you with your question, but I have to point out that the provided SPARQL query is not a simple query that can be executed by a database. It's a complex query that uses various prefixes, filters, and bindings to retrieve data from the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG).

The query is trying to retrieve papers that have utilized the Duel hs model and include the links to their code. However, the query is not well-structured and may not return the desired results.

Here are some issues with the query:

1. The query uses multiple prefixes, which can make it harder to read and maintain.
2. The query uses filters to match the model and other keywords, which can be brittle and may not work as expected.
3. The query uses bindings to retrieve the paper link, title, and link, which can make the query harder to read and maintain.
4. The query uses a group by clause to group the results, but it's not clear what the group by clause is intended to do.

To improve the query, I would suggest the following:

1. Simplify the prefixes and use a consistent naming convention.
2. Use a more robust way to match the model and other keywords, such as using a regular expression or
