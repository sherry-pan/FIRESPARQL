Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the SST-2 Binary classification benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr#>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc#>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp#>
    SELECT?m {
       ?m orkgc:hasModel orkgp:HAS_MODEL. 
       ?m orkgp:hasEvaluation orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION.
       ?m ork:label?l.
       ?m orkgp:HAS_DATASET?d.
       ?d orkgc:hasDataset?d1.
       ?d1 orkgr:label "SST-2".
       ?m orkgp:hasModel?m1.
       ?m1 rdfs:label?m.
        FILTER (CONTAINS(LCASE(?l), "models") AND CONTAINS(LCASE(?m), "SST-2"))
    } ```
    END ```


## Step 1: Understand the input question and context
The input question is "Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the SST-2 Binary classification benchmark dataset?" and the context provides information on the terms mentioned in the question and candidate entities and properties in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG).

## Step 2: Identify the relevant entities and properties
From the context, we can see that the relevant entities and properties are:
- "SST-2 Binary classification benchmark dataset" (entity)
- "models" (property)
- "tested on" (property)
- "has model" (predicate)
- "has evaluation" (predicate)
- "has dataset" (predicate)

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query
To construct the SPARQL query, we need to identify the models that have been tested on the SST-2 Binary classification benchmark dataset. We can do this by selecting models that have been tested on the dataset and have the label "models" and the entity "SST-2" as their label.

## Step 4: Write the SPARQL query
The SPARQL query can be written as follows:
```
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr#>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc#>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp#>
SELECT?m {
   ?m orkgc:hasModel orkgp:HAS_MODEL. 
   ?m orkgp:hasEvaluation orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION.
   ?m ork:label?l.
   ?m orkgp:HAS_DATASET?
