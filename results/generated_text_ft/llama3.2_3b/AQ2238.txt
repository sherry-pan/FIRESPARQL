Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the MPAD-path model for benchmarking purposes?

    Note: The query uses a mix of the schema.org vocabulary and the ORKG vocabulary. The query uses the `strContains` function to check for the presence of specific strings in the topic and paper labels. The query also uses the `hasPart` and `hasTopic` properties to navigate the graph and retrieve the desired information. The `LIMIT 10` clause is used to limit the number of results returned. 

    Note 2: The query assumes that the MPAD-path model has been used in papers that have a specific label (e.g., "benchmarking") and that the papers have a specific topic that contains the MPAD-path model (e.g., "MPAD-path"). 

    This query is not a one-to-one mapping of the input question to the SPARQL query. Instead, it uses a set of heuristics and assumptions to generate a query that is likely to retrieve the desired information. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to be executed on the ORKG, and the results should be filtered and ranked according to the relevance and accuracy of the retrieved information.
