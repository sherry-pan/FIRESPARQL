    This is the SPARQL query that can be used to answer the input question. The query uses the provided context to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG. The query first finds the models that have been benchmarked on the CIFAR-100 dataset, then filters the results to only include models that performed best in terms of FLOPS metric. The query returns the model and its corresponding FLOPS metric. 

    Please note that the actual values of the FLOPS metric are not provided in the context, so the query uses a filter to only include models with a non-zero FLOPS metric. 

    If you want to get the model that performed best in terms of FLOPS metric on the CIFAR-100 benchmark dataset, you can simply run this SPARQL query on the ORKG. 

    Note: The actual prefixes and URIs used in the query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG. 

    Also, the query assumes that the entities and properties mentioned in the question are correctly linked in the ORKG. If there are any errors in the linking, the query may not return the correct results. 

    Finally, the query uses a simple filter to only include models with a non-zero FLOPS metric. If you want to get the model that
