Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the code links in papers that use the Long Short Transformer model in any benchmark?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "Long Short Transformer model" and "papers." The properties involved are "code links" and "benchmarks." So, I'm looking for papers that use the Long Short Transformer and have code links associated with any benchmarks.

Next, I'll look through the provided context to find related information. The context has two main sections. The first part describes a research process with steps involving NER and linking. The second part talks about a paper titled "validation research" with authors and a DOI link.

Looking at the second file path, I see a resource R284317 which is a Journal Article with a URL "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075" and a DOI "10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075". This seems like a paper that might be relevant. However, the paper's title isn't explicitly mentioned, but it's categorized under "validation research" and "technique." 

I don't see any direct mention of the "Long Short Transformer model" in the context. The first part of the context discusses methods like SVM and MNIST, which are different. The second part's paper is about entity recognition and linking, which might not be directly related to the Long Short Transformer.

Since the context doesn't provide specific information about the Long Short Transformer model or its usage in benchmarks, I can't find exact matches. However, I can infer that the paper with the DOI might be a candidate if it's related to models or benchmarks, even if it's not explicitly stated.

So, I'll structure the answer by extracting the terms and then listing the candidate entities based on the available data. The paper's URI and DOI will be the main candidates, even though they might not perfectly match the Long Short Transformer model.
