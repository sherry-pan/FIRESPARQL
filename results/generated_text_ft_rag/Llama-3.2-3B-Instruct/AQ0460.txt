Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WebQuestions dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
           FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WebQuestions")
        ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                         orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
        ?paper         orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
        ?paper         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
     }```


    Note: You may assume the required JSON output format is as shown in the provided example. The provided answer is the only one that satisfies the required format. The SPARQL query provided is not the only query that would satisfy the input question, but it is the one that the provided answer corresponds to. 

    Also, note that the answer is based on the provided context and the task's requirements. The answer might not be the only possible answer, but it is the one that corresponds to the provided context and the task's requirements. 

    The answer is provided in the required format, which is a JSON list of objects. Each object contains the required fields (uri, label, and score) and is formatted as specified. The SPARQL query is also provided in the required format, which is a SELECT statement that retrieves the required data from the ORKG.
