    The code in the model's source code repository is located at https://github.com/google-research/transformer_xl. The Transformer-XL Base model is a variant of the Transformer-XL model. It is a neural network model that is pre-trained on large language models, such as BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet. It has been used in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including question answering, sentiment analysis, and text classification. The Transformer-XL Base model is known for its ability to handle long-range dependencies and its use of self-attention mechanisms. It has been widely adopted in the NLP community due to its high performance and ease of use. The Transformer-XL Base model is also known for its ability to handle out-of-vocabulary words and its use of contextualized embeddings. It has been used in various applications, including language translation, text summarization, and question answering.
