Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the AAPD dataset?

     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper a orkg:ResearchPaper.
    ?paper orkg:hasTitle?title.
    ?paper orkg:hasID?id.
    ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset?dataset.
    ?dataset rdfs:label "AAPD".
     FILTER (?benchmark orkg:hasBenchmarkOn?dataset)
     }<|eot_id|>
