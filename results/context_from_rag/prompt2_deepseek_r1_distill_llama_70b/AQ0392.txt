Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the query: "Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "research paper titles", "models", and "Penn Treebank dataset". The property involved is "benchmarked on".

Looking through the context, I see two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a research paper with steps involving SVM and MNIST, but it doesn't mention Penn Treebank. R284316 is about extracting entity knowledge and uses datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP, but not Penn Treebank.

Since the context doesn't have any direct mentions of the Penn Treebank dataset, I can't find any matching papers. Therefore, the candidates for each term will be empty.
