Question:
What is the best performing model benchmarking the Atari 2600 Montezuma's Revenge dataset in terms of Average Return (NoOp) metric?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/city>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/paper>

    SELECT?model?metric
    WHERE {
   ?model orkg:hasBestPerformance?bestModel.
   ?bestModel orkg:hasDataset?dataset.
   ?dataset orkg:hasMetric?metric.
   ?metric orkg:hasAverageReturn?avgReturn.
   ?avgReturn orkg:hasNoOp?noOp.
    FILTER (STR(?model) = "best performing model").
    FILTER (STR(?metric) = "Average Return (NoOp) metric").
    }
    ``` 
    This code will return the best performing model that benchmarks the Atari 2600 Montezuma's Revenge dataset in terms of Average Return (NoOp) metric. 

    Note that the actual query execution may require additional setup and configuration depending on the ORKG infrastructure. 

    The SPARQL query uses the following prefixes:
    - orkg: for the Open Research Knowledge Graph ontology
    - orkgc: for the City ontology (not used in this query)
    - orkgp: for the Paper ontology (not used in this query)
    The query selects the model and metric variables, and filters the results to only include the best performing model that benchmarks the Atari 2600 Montezuma's Revenge dataset in terms of Average Return (NoOp) metric. 

    The query works by following these steps:
    1. It finds the best performing model that has a best performance (line 1).
    2. It finds the best performing model that has a dataset (line 2).
    3. It finds the best performing model that has a metric (line 3).
    4. It finds the best performing model that has an average return (line 4).
    5. It finds the best performing model that has no-op (line 5).
    6. It filters the results to only include the model and metric variables that match the extracted terms (lines 6-7).
    The query returns the best performing model and the metric it benchmarks. 

    Note that the actual query
