Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the STEM-ECR v1.0 dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "evaluation metrics" and "STEM-ECR v1.0 dataset". The property is "benchmarking models on".

Next, I'll look through the context information to find similar entities and properties. From the context, I see mentions of "validation research", "technique", and various papers with metrics like "93.9". There's also information about models such as SVM and datasets like MNIST.

I'll compute the cosine similarity between the extracted terms and the entities in the context. For "evaluation metrics", terms like "validation research" and "HAS_VALUE" (which has "93.9") seem relevant. For "STEM-ECR v1.0 dataset", "MNIST" and "ACL Anthology dataset" from the example are similar. The property "benchmarking models on" relates to "evaluated on" and "P37015" which is about journal articles.

Now, I'll select the top 5 candidates for each term. For "evaluation metrics", I'll include "validation research", "HAS_VALUE", "technique", "Journal Article", and "P37015". For "STEM-ECR v1.0 dataset", the candidates are "MNIST", "ACL Anthology dataset", "SVM", "NERC", and "EL". The property "benchmarking models on" will have "evaluated on", "P97004", "P97005", "P5044", and "P37015".

I need to structure this into a JSON object with the extracted terms and their candidates, ensuring the correct RDF prefixes and types are used. Each candidate should have a URI, label, score, type, and RDF type.

Finally, I'll make sure the JSON follows the specified format, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including all necessary details for each candidate.
