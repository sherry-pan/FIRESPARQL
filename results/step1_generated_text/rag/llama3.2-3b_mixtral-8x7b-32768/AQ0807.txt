    Note: The answer to the question "List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Story Cloze Test benchmark dataset?" is ["Accuracy", "F1 Score", "Precision", "Recall", "Perplexity"].
    Note: The provided SPARQL query does not return the answer as expected. The query has a logical error. The query should be modified to filter the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Story Cloze Test benchmark dataset.
    Note: The query uses the "hasMetric" property, but it should be "hasEvaluation" to filter the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Story Cloze Test benchmark dataset.
    Note: The query uses the "Evaluation" label, but it should be "hasEvaluation" property to filter the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Story Cloze Test benchmark dataset.
