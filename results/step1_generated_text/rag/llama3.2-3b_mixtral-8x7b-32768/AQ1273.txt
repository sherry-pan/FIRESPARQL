Note: The above SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context and input question. The query is designed to query the ORKG and retrieve the top benchmark score and its metric on the Atari 2600 Centipede dataset. 

The query first filters games that have the Centipede dataset and the Centipede game. Then it filters the scores of these games and binds a default score value of 100. Finally, it filters the scores that have a metric and selects the score and its metric. 

Please note that the actual query might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG and the specific entities and properties defined in the graph. 

The actual score value might also need to be retrieved from the ORKG based on the actual structure of the graph.
