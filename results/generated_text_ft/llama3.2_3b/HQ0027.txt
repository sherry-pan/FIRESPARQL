Question:
For which country of study overall prevalence of epilepsy is the highest?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/resource/>
     PREFIX wgs84: <http://www.wgs84.org/def/geo/coordinates/>
     SELECT?country?prevalence
     WHERE {
      ?country orkg:studyCountry?c.
      ?c wgs84:latitude?lat.
      ?c wgs84:longitude?lon.
      ?c orkg:epilepsyPrevalence?prevalence.
       ORDER BY DESC(?prevalence)
       LIMIT 1
     } 

    Note: You may assume that the country of study is the country where the center of the bounding box of the 
    geographical area where the study was conducted is located. The prevalence of epilepsy is a real-world value 
    (i.e., a number) which can be retrieved from the ORKG.

    The input question is assumed to be answered by a user who is familiar with the ORKG. 
    The ORKG data is assumed to be available at the time of query. 

    Assume that the country of study is the country where the center of the bounding box of the geographical area 
    where the study was conducted is located. 
    The prevalence of epilepsy is a real-world value (i.e., a number) which can be retrieved from the ORKG. 

    This is not a typical question-answering task, but rather a query task. The goal is to generate a query 
    that can be executed by a SPARQL endpoint. 

    SPARQL query syntax is used to generate the query. The query may use the RDF data model and/or the SPARQL 
    query language. 

    The generated SPARQL query should be able to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question. 
    Assume that the query is executed on the ORKG. 

    The answer to the input question is the country of study with the highest overall prevalence of epilepsy. 
    The answer is not necessarily the most up-to-date information, but rather the most accurate answer based on the 
    data available at the time of query. 

    The SPARQL query should be efficient, i.e., it should not query too many resources, and it should not fetch too 
    much data. 
    The SPARQL query should be correct, i.e., it should return the correct answer based on the data in the ORKG. 
    The SPARQL query should be well-formed, i.e., it should conform to the SPARQL query syntax. 

    Assume that the query is executed on the ORKG, and that the query is answered by a user who is familiar with the 
    ORKG.

    The prevalence of epilepsy is a real-world value (i.e., a number) which can be retrieved from the ORKG. 
    Assume that the prevalence of epilepsy is highest for the country with the highest prevalence value.
