Question:
What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the WMT2014 English-German dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric?value
     WHERE {
     orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
    ?metric orkgp:HAS_VALUE?value.
     FILTER(REGEX(STR(?value), ".*\\d+"))
     {
     orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK_RESULT?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_VALUE?value.
     }
     FILTER(REGEX(STR(?value), ".*\\d+"))
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(?value)
     LIMIT 1

    Note: The output SPARQL query is provided as an example. It may not be the only correct SPARQL query to answer the input question.

    ```python
def get_sparql_query(question):
    # Process the question and extract relevant information
    #...

    # Generate the SPARQL query
    sparql_query = """
        SELECT?metric?value
        WHERE {
            orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
           ?metric orkgp:HAS_VALUE?value.
            FILTER(REGEX(STR(?value), ".*\\d+"))
            {
                orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK_RESULT?benchmark.
               ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_VALUE?value.
            }
            FILTER(REGEX(STR(?value), ".*\\d+"))
        }
        ORDER BY DESC(?value)
        LIMIT 1
    """

    return sparql_query
````

    To generate the correct SPARQL query, we need to follow these steps:

1.  **Identify the entities and properties mentioned in the question**: The question mentions the following entities and properties:
    *   Dataset: WMT2014 English-German
    *   Benchmark result
    *   Metric
    *   Value
2.  **Link the entities and properties to the ORKG**: The provided context includes candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question. These are:
    *   Dataset: orkgp:R147244
    *   Benchmark result: orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK_RESULT
    *   Metric: orkgp:HAS_METRIC
    *   Value: orkgp:HAS_VALUE
3.  **Construct the SPARQL query**: The SPARQL query should retrieve the highest benchmark result achieved on the WMT2014 English-German dataset, including the metric and its value. This can be achieved by querying the following:
    *   orkgp:R1 (the dataset) and orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric (the metric) to retrieve the metric.
    *  ?metric and orkgp:HAS
