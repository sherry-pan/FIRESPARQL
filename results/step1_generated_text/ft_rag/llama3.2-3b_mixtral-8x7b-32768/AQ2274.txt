Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PEGASUS model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
    ?code rdfs:label
     FILTER (str(?code) = "code references")
     WHERE {
      ?model    orkgp:P31    orkgc:Model.
      ?model    orkgp:P32    orkgp:HAS_MODEL.    
      ?model    orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK   ?benchmark.
      ?benchmark    orkgp:HAS_CODE_REFERENCE   ?code.
      ?code    rdfs:label   ?code
       }     


```sql
SELECT?code
?code rdfs:label
FILTER (str(?code) = "code references")
WHERE {
 ?model    orkgp:P31    orkgc:Model.
 ?model    orkgp:P32    orkgp:HAS_MODEL.    
 ?model    orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK   ?benchmark.
 ?benchmark    orkgp:HAS_CODE_REFERENCE   ?code.
 ?code    rdfs:label   ?code
}
```


    Note: I have assumed the orkgp and orkgc prefixes to be defined in the context, if not, the query would not work as expected.

    I have also assumed that the code references are referenced by the "code references" string. If this is not the case, the filter condition would need to be adjusted. 

    The query can be optimized by adding additional filters based on the candidates. For example, it could filter out models that do not use the PEGASUS model for benchmarking purposes.

    Note that the query uses the rdfs:label property to retrieve the label of the code references. This is because the filter condition is checking for the string "code references" which is not a direct property of the code references.

    Finally, the query only returns the code references that have the label "code references". If other code references are also present, they will not be returned.
