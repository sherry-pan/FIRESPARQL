Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The query is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the Large mLSTM model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "papers" and "Large mLSTM model". The property mentioned is "utilized" or "include links to their code". 

Looking at the context data, I see several resources related to papers and models. For example, R147246 and R283710 are papers with authors and publication details. However, I don't see any direct mention of the "Large mLSTM model" in the context. 

Since the model isn't explicitly mentioned, I'll look for related terms. The context does talk about methods like SVM and techniques like keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition. There's also a mention of models in the context of NER approaches using CRF algorithms. 

For the papers, I can extract the resources like R147246 and R283710, which are both papers with specific authors and years. Each of these can be candidates under the "papers" term. 

The property "utilized" might relate to how these papers used certain models or methods. Since the context doesn't have a direct property for "utilized", I'll map it to a relevant predicate like P27, which lists authors, or P31, which indicates the type of resource. 

Including links to code isn't directly addressed in the context, so I'll have to omit that part or note that the information isn't available in the provided data.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and the top candidates from the context, even though the specific model and code links aren't present.
