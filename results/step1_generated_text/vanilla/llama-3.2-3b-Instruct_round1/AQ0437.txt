Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the STL-10 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT?paper?title?id WHERE {
 ?paper a dbo:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper dbo:hasBenchmark dbo:STL10.
  SERVICE wikibase:label {
    bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en".
  }
}
```<|eot_id|>
