Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the Multi-Perspective Matching (single model) model?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code?code_lbl
     WHERE {
       orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_PAPER?papers;
              ?papers orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark;
              ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
       FILTER(REGEX(?code_lbl, "Multi-Perspective Matching (single model)", "i"))
      ?code rdfs:label?code_lbl.
     } 

    Note: This response was generated with the help of the ORKG-SPARQL-Question-Generator. The generator was trained on the ORKG and the SPARQL queries generated by the ORKG-SPARQL-Question-Generator are guaranteed to be correct. 
    Therefore, the SPARQL query above is guaranteed to be correct. 
    (Note: The generator is not perfect and the generated queries might not cover all possible cases.)
