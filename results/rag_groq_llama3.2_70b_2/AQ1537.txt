To address the given query, we'll follow the steps outlined:

1. **Extract entities and properties from the question**: The question mentions "top performing model," "Number of params score," "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset." These are the key entities and properties we're interested in.

2. **Retrieve similar entities or properties from the RDF data dump**: We need to calculate the cosine similarity between the question and the labels of entities/properties in the RDF dump. However, given the format of the provided data, we'll focus on entities and their labels for simplicity.

3. **Calculate cosine similarity**: This step involves converting text into vectors and comparing them. For simplicity, we'll consider the labels of entities in the RDF data and compare them with the question.

Given the complexity of the task and the need for a computational approach to calculate cosine similarity, I'll provide a conceptual answer based on the information provided:

- **Entity Extraction**: From the question, key terms are "top performing model," "Number of params score," and "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset."
- **Similarity Calculation**: We would calculate the cosine similarity between these terms and the labels of entities in the RDF data. For example, entities like "BioBERT achieved the highest F1 scores" might have some similarity due to the mention of performance metrics.

**Hypothetical Top 5 Similar Entities/Properties**:

```json
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R44252",
    "label": "BioBERT achieved the highest F1 scores",
    "score": 0.8
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524",
    "label": "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire",
    "score": 0.6
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211922",
    "label": "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)",
    "score": 0.55
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36053",
    "label": "Proceedings of the 2007 conference on Digital libraries  - JCDL '07",
    "score": 0.4
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211319",
    "label": "Component for template R206311",
    "score": 0.35
  }
]
```

**Note**: The scores and selection of entities are hypothetical, as the actual calculation of cosine similarity requires a computational approach and access to the full RDF dataset for accurate vector representation and comparison. This answer provides a conceptual framework for how one might approach the task based on the information given.
