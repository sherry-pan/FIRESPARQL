Question:
List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Atari 2600 Battle Zone benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?metric
WHERE {
 ?benchmark    orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
  FILTER(REGEX(STR(?dataset), "Atari 2600 Battle Zone"))
 ?dataset      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
 ?eval          rdfs:label              ?eval_lbl.
 ?eval          orkgp:P32              ?metric.
}
``` 
    Note: The above SPARQL query is based on the provided context and may not be the most accurate or efficient query to retrieve the desired results. It is intended to illustrate the process of generating a SPARQL query from a natural language question. 

    Please note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG RDF data. 

    Also, the query may not return the exact results expected, as the provided context and RDF data may not contain the specific information needed to answer the question.
