Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the MPQA dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/resource/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/resource/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/resource/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/resource/>

SELECT?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgc:hasBenchmarkedModel?model.
 ?model orkgp:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
 ?evaluation orkgr:hasBenchmarkedDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgr:label?title.
 ?paper orkgc:hasId?id.
}
```

    Note that you will not be able to run the above SPARQL query on any actual knowledge graph. This is just an example of how to construct a valid SPARQL query given the provided question and context. 

    The query is constructed based on the following rules:
    1. The question contains the terms "research paper titles and IDs", "benchmarked models", and "MPQA dataset". 
    2. The candidates contain the entities "research paper titles and IDs", "benchmarked models", "MPQA dataset", and other properties.
    3. The query aims to find all research papers that have benchmarked models on the MPQA dataset.
    4. The query uses the following predicates:
        * orkg:hasBenchmarkedModel
        * orkgp:hasEvaluation
        * orkgr:hasBenchmarkedDataset
        * orkgr:label
        * orkgc:hasId
    5. The query uses the following graph patterns:
        *?paper orkgc:hasBenchmarkedModel?model.
        *?model orkgp:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
        *?evaluation orkgr:hasBenchmarkedDataset?dataset.
        *?dataset orkgr:label?title.
        *?paper orkgc:hasId?id.
```

    The SPARQL query is constructed by combining the rules above to generate the query. The query is not optimized for performance and is only provided as an example of how to construct a valid SPARQL query given the provided question and context.
