Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Stanford Cars dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/>
     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
      ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset <http://orkg.org/orkg/dataset/stanford-cars>.
       SERVICE orkg:search {
        ?paper orkg:titles?title.
        ?paper orkg:name?id.
       }
     }<|eot_id|>
