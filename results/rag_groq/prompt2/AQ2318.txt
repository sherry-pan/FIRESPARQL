Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking for a list of papers that used the Rainbow+SEER model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information. The context has two main sections from the ORKG RDF dump. The first part describes a research process with five steps, and the second part talks about a journal article titled "validation research" with some authors and a DOI link.

I notice that the model mentioned in the context is jpark, which is used for improving entity annotations. There's no mention of the Rainbow+SEER model in the provided data. The papers listed in the context are about validation research and another study, but neither of them reference the Rainbow+SEER model.

Since the context doesn't contain any information about the Rainbow+SEER model or papers that used it, I can't extract any relevant entities or properties related to the query. Therefore, the extracted terms and candidates would be empty because there's no matching data in the provided context.
