    Note: The LIMIT 10 is used to limit the output to the top 10 results. The actual number of results may vary depending on the number of papers and their corresponding metrics. 

    To generate the SPARQL query, we need to create an entity and property from the extracted terms and candidates.
    We will create an entity and property from the term "Raman spectroscopy" and the candidate entity "Raman spectroscopy" from the candidates.
    We will create an entity and property from the term "Raman spectroscopy" and the candidate property "HAS_DATASET" from the candidates.
