Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the RotoWire (Relation Generation) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/orkg#>
     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset "RotoWire".
    ?benchmark orkg:evaluation?evaluation.
    ?evaluation orkg:title?evaluationTitle.
    ?paper orkg:title?title.
    ?paper orkg:id?id.
     FILTER (strstarts-with(?evaluationTitle, "RotoWireBenchmark"))
     }<|eot_id|>
