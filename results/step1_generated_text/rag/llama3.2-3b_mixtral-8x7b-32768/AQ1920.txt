Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Funnel Transformer model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?paperCode
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:Contribution.
  ora:HAS_PAPER?hasPaper.
 ?hasPaper ora:UTILIZES?utilizesModel.
 ?utilizesModel ora:HAS_CODE?paperCode.
  FILTER (?utilizesModel = <http://example.org/FunnelTransformer>.
  FILTER (regex(?paper, ".*papers.*"))
}
```


    Note: The `ora` namespace is used for the `Contribution` class, and the `orkgp` namespace is used for the `HAS_PAPER`, `UTILIZES`, and `HAS_CODE` predicates. The `regex` function is used to filter the papers with the word "papers" in the title. The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the `utilizesModel` to only include the "FunnelTransformer" model. 

    Note: The `http://example.org/FunnelTransformer` is a placeholder for the actual URI of the "FunnelTransformer" model. You may need to replace it with the actual URI in the ORKG. 

    Note: The `regex` function is used to filter the papers with the word "papers" in the title. You may need to adjust the regular expression to match the actual title format of the papers in the ORKG.
