Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the MMV model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper    a            orkgc:Paper;
              rdfs:label   ?paper_lbl.
       FILTER(REGEX(?paper_lbl, "MMV"))
      ?paper    orkgp:P31   ?cont.
      ?cont      orkgp:P32   ?benchmark.
      ?benchmark    orkgp:P3306   ?code.
     }<|eot_id|>
