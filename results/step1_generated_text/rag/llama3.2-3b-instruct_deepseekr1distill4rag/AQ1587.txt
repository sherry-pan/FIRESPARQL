Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of F1 metric on the PubMed 20k RCT benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset?f1
WHERE {
 ?model rdfs:label?label.
 ?dataset rdfs:label?dataset_label.
 ?model ora:is_improved_by?jpark.
 ?jpark ora:is_improved_on?dataset.
 ?dataset ora:has_f1_score?f1.
  FILTER (?f1 > 0.8)
}
```    Output End.
```

    Note: The SPARQL query is based on the analysis provided in the `think` section. The query is designed to retrieve the model that performed best in terms of F1 metric on the PubMed 20k RCT benchmark dataset, taking into account the context and the extracted terms. The query uses the `ora:is_improved_by` and `ora:is_improved_on` properties to link the jpark model to the dataset, and the `ora:has_f1_score` property to retrieve the F1 score. The `FILTER` clause is used to filter out datasets with F1 scores less than or equal to 0.8.<|eot_id|>
