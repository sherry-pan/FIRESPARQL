Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the WMT2014 French-English dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
SELECT?metric?label
WHERE {
 ?dataset a orkg:Dataset.
 ?dataset orkgp:hasDataset?dataset2.
 ?dataset2 orkgp:hasEvaluationMetric?metric.
 ?metric orkgp:hasMetric?metricLabel.
 ?metric orkgp:hasMetric?metricLabel.
  FILTER (STR(?metricLabel) = "BLEU")
}
```
    Note that the actual SPARQL query should be generated based on the input question and the provided context. The query provided above is just a sample query that uses the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The actual query may need to be modified to correctly retrieve the answer to the input question. 

    The SPARQL query should be able to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question. 

    The context provides candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The actual query should use these candidate entities and properties to correctly retrieve the answer to the input question. 

    The actual SPARQL query may need to use additional logic or filters to correctly retrieve the answer to the input question.
