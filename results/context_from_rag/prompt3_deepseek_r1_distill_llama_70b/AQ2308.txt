Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user's question is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the A3C FF hs model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "papers" and "A3C FF hs model". The properties involved would be "utilized" and "links to their code". 

Looking at the context data, I see that there are several resources related to papers, such as R147246 and R283710, which have authors and publication details. However, I don't see any mention of the A3C FF hs model in the provided context. The context includes information about methods like SVM and MNIST, and entities like "Graph analytics" and "Named entity recognition", but nothing specific to A3C FF hs.

Since the A3C FF hs model isn't present in the context, I can't find any direct matches for it. The papers listed in the context, like R147246 and R283710, are about topics like keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition, which don't relate to the A3C model. 

I also check for any properties that might relate to code links, but the context doesn't provide such information. The properties mentioned are about things like HAS_VALUE, P31, HAS_VENUE, P29, P28, P27, etc., which don't include links to code.

Given that the context doesn't contain the specific model or code links, the candidates for "A3C FF hs model" and "links to their code" would be empty. The only candidates I can provide are the papers from the context, but they aren't related to the A3C model.

So, the final answer would list the extracted terms and include the papers from the context as candidates, but without any matches for the model or code links.
