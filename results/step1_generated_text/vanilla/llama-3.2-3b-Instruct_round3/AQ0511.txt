Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the STS Benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT?paper?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper rdf:type owl:Ontology.
 ?paper rdfs:label?title.
 ?paper stsb:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark stsb:hasDataset "STS Benchmark".
  SERVICE dbpedia:SPARQL
  {
    BIND(iri(?benchmark) as?benchmarkIri)
    SELECT?id?paper?title
    WHERE {
     ?benchmark stsb:hasBenchmark?benchmarkIri.
     ?benchmark stsb:hasPaper?paper.
     ?paper stsb:hasID?id.
      FILTER(LONG(?id) > 0)
    }
  }
}<|eot_id|>
