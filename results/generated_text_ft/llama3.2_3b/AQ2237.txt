Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the BCN+ELMo model and include the links to their code?

    Note: The SPARQL query uses the following concepts:
    * Papers (w:Q123456789)
    * Authors (w:Q123456780)
    * Types (w:Q123456791)
    * Links (w:Q123456802)
    * Code (w:Q123456813)
    * BCN+ELMo model (bcnelmo:BCN+ELMo)
    * Model IDs (bcnelmo:BCN+ELMo#1, bcnelmo:BCN+ELMo#2,...)

    You can use any additional namespaces as needed. 

    I hope this is correct. Let me know if there is anything I can improve. 

    Here is the breakdown of the properties used:
    * wdt:P275: author
    * wdt:P279: type
    * wdt:P146: link
    * wdt:P577: code

    I have found that the query is slow and can be optimized. There are several ways to optimize this query:
    1.  **Indexing**: Create indexes on the properties used in the WHERE clause to improve query performance.
    2.  **Caching**: Implement caching to store the results of expensive queries, reducing the load on the database.
    3.  **Optimizing the query structure**: Reorganize the query to reduce the number of joins and minimize the amount of data being retrieved.
    4.  **Using more efficient data types**: Convert data types to more efficient formats, such as using binary literals for date and time values.
    5.  **Avoiding unnecessary queries**: Remove unnecessary queries and reduce the number of iterations over the data.
    6.  6.  **Using more efficient algorithms**: Optimize the algorithms used to process the data, such as using more efficient sorting algorithms.
    7.  **Optimizing the database**: Optimize the underlying database to improve query performance, such as by indexing, partitioning, or reorganizing the data.
    8.  **Using parallel processing**: Use parallel processing to speed up the query execution time.
    9.  **Optimizing the query language**: Optimize the query language itself, such as
