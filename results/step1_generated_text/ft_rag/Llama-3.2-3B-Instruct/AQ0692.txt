Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the ARC-PDN dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?metric
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
           FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "ARC-PDN")
          ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
          ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
          ?cont           rkgp:P32               ?model.
          ?model          rkgp:HAS_EVALUATION     ?eval.
          ?eval           rdfs:label               ?metric.
     }     RETURN?metric AS?metric_lbl. 
```
    Note: The above SPARQL query is designed to find the evaluation metrics for the ARC-PDN dataset. However, since the dataset is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, the query may not yield accurate results. The query is based on the assumption that the metrics used for ImageNet could be similar to those used for ARC-PDN. The output is a list of evaluation metrics, along with their labels, which can be used to infer the metrics used for ARC-PDN. 

    This query will return all the evaluation metrics that are commonly used in the ORKG dataset. However, it may not be specific to the ARC-PDN dataset. You may need to adjust the query based on the specific requirements of your project. 

    Also, note that the `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include datasets with the label "ARC-PDN". However, since the dataset is not explicitly mentioned in the provided context, this filter may not be effective. 

    The `RETURN` clause is used to format the output as a list of evaluation metrics and their labels. The `?metric_lbl` variable is used to store the label of each metric, which is then returned as part of the output. 

    The `AS` keyword is used to assign an alias to the `?metric` variable, which is then used to store the label of each metric. 

    The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to ensure that each evaluation metric is only returned once in the output. 

    The `SELECT` clause is used to specify the variables that are to be returned in the output. In this case, the `?metric` variable is selected. 

    The `WHERE` clause is used to specify the conditions under which the query will return results. In this case, the query checks for the presence of a dataset with the label "ARC-PDN", and then checks for the presence of an evaluation metric for that dataset. 

    The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results based on the presence of the dataset with the label "ARC-PDN".
