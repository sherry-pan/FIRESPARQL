Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the EfficientNetV2-L model for benchmarking purposes?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The key entities and properties mentioned are "EfficientNetV2-L model" and "benchmarking purposes." The question is asking about finding code references in papers, so I also need to consider terms related to papers and code.

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a method involving steps like using seed terms, expanding with SciBERT, annotating entities, applying NER with CRF, and filtering candidates. R147244 has a value of "93.9," which might be an accuracy score. R147246 is linked to authors and a venue, indicating it's a paper. R283709 and R283710 are about publications, with R283709 being a journal article and R283710 having authors like Yuanyuan Wu and others.

I need to find entities related to the EfficientNetV2-L model. In the context, I don't see any direct mention of EfficientNetV2-L, but there are mentions of models like SVM and datasets like MNIST. However, since the context doesn't have the specific model, I'll have to infer based on the structure.

For benchmarking purposes, I can look for predicates related to evaluation or benchmarking. The context has P5044 as "Journal Article," P41924 as "scholarly domain," P97005 as "method," P97004 as "solution proposal," P97003 as "entity extraction," and P3000 with keywords like "Graph analytics," "Horizon 2020," etc. There's also P27 for authors, P28 for volume, P29 for year, P31 for type, and HAS_VENUE.

Since the question is about code references in papers using EfficientNetV2-L for benchmarking, I'll focus on terms like "code references," "papers," "EfficientNetV2-L," and "benchmarking."

Extracting terms:
- "EfficientNetV2-L model"
- "benchmarking purposes"
- "code references"
- "papers"

Now, I'll look for similar entities or properties in the context. For "EfficientNetV2-L model," the closest is "models" mentioned in the steps. For "benchmarking purposes," terms like "evaluation" or "benchmark" might be relevant. "Code references" could relate to "deliverables" or "publications." "Papers" are linked via P27, P28, etc.

I'll map these to the RDF structure. For "EfficientNetV2-L model," since it's not present, I'll look for model-related resources. R147652 is about a method, which might be a model. R283709 and R283710 are papers, so they might have code references.

For "benchmarking purposes," I'll look for predicates like P5044 (Journal Article) or P97005 (method). "Code references" might be linked via HAS_VENUE or other properties indicating where the code is stored.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the extracted terms and their candidates. Since EfficientNetV2-L isn't in the context, I'll use the closest model-related resources. For benchmarking, I'll use evaluation-related predicates. For code references, I'll consider deliverables or publications. For papers, I'll include the specific paper resources.

I need to ensure the URIs use the correct prefixes: orkgr: for resources, orkgp: for predicates, etc. Each candidate should have a URI, label, and type.

Finally, I'll format the JSON, grouping the results by each extracted term and listing the top candidates with their details.
