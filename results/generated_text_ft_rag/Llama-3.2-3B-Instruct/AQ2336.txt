Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the DQN-PixelCNN model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code?code_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P31?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P32?model.
       FILTER(REGEX(STR(?model), "DQN-PixelCNN", "i"))
      ?model rdfs:label?code_lbl.
      ?model orkgp:P31?paper.
      ?paper orkgp:P32?model.
      ?model rdfs:label?code.
       BIND(XSD:integer(1) AS?score).
     } UNION
     SELECT?paper?paper_lbl?code?code_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P31?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P32?model.
      ?model rdfs:label?code_lbl.
      ?model orkgp:P31?paper.
      ?paper orkgp:P32?model.
      ?model rdfs:label?code.
       BIND(XSD:integer(1) AS?score).
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(?score)
     LIMIT 5
```


    The provided SPARQL query can be broken down into several parts:
    1. The first part of the query is used to find papers that mention the DQN-PixelCNN model. It uses the `FILTER(REGEX(STR(?model), "DQN-PixelCNN", "i"))` to search for the model's name in the model's label. However, since this query does not find any matches, it will not return any results.
    2. The second part of the query is used to find papers that do not mention the DQN-PixelCNN model. It uses the `FILTER(XSD:integer(1) AS?score)` to assign a score of 1 to all papers, and then sorts the results in descending order by score.
    3. The `ORDER BY DESC(?score)` clause is used to sort the results in descending order by score.
    4. The `LIMIT 5` clause is used to limit the number of results to 5.
    5. The `SELECT?code?code_lbl` clause is used to select the code and label of the papers.
    6. The `?code_lbl` and `?code` are selected using the `?model rdfs:label?code_lbl` and `?model orkgp:P31?paper` clauses, respectively.
    7. The `?paper` and `?paper_lbl` are selected using the `?cont orkgp:P32?model` and `?cont orkgp:P31?cont` clauses, respectively.
    8. The `BIND(XSD:integer(1) AS?score)` clause is used to assign a score of 1 to all papers.
    9. The `UNION` operator is used to combine the results of the two parts of the query.
    10. The `ORKG` prefix is used to access the ORKG data.
    11. The `RDF` prefix is used to access the RDF data.
    12. The `XSD` prefix is used to access the XSD data.<|eot_id|>
