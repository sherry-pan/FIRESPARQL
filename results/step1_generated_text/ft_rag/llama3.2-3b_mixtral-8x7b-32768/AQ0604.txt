Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Atari 2600 Venture dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?papers?papers_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
           FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Venture dataset")
          ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
          ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark;
                          orkgp:P32             ?papers.
          ?papers         rdfs:label              ?papers_lbl.
         }
     }    


    The above SPARQL query is not correct. The query should return a list of papers that have performed benchmarks on the specified dataset. The query should return papers that have the dataset as a value for the "HAS_DATASET" property, and papers that have the "HAS_BENCHMARK" property with a value that is a list containing the dataset. This means that the query should look for papers that have performed benchmarks on the specified dataset.

    The correct SPARQL query should be:
     SELECT?papers?papers_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
           FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Venture dataset")
          ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
          ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
          ?papers         rdfs:label              ?papers_lbl;
                          orkgp:P32             ?cont.
         }
     }

    Note that the original query had a SELECT statement that selected the "papers" variable, but then used the "papers_lbl" variable to output the results. This was incorrect, as the "papers_lbl" variable was not defined anywhere in the query. The correct query selects the "papers" variable, which is then used to output the results. 

    The original query also had a filter statement that filtered on the "papers" variable, but this was incorrect, as the "papers" variable was not
