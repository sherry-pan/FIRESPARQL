Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What is the name of the top performing model in terms of NLL score when benchmarked on the Nottingham dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "model" and "Nottingham dataset". The property mentioned is "NLL score".

Looking through the context, I see that there are two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a method with several steps, and R284316 talks about a journal article on extracting entity knowledge.

I need to find entities related to models and datasets. In the context, R147652 mentions "SVM" and "MNIST" as seed terms. R284316 discusses various tools like Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL. It also mentions datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP, but not Nottingham.

Since the Nottingham dataset isn't in the context, I'll look for similar datasets. The closest is "MNIST" mentioned in R147652. For models, R284316 refers to tools like Flair NER and others, which are models used in NLP tasks.

I'll compute similarity scores based on the textual representations. "MNIST" is a dataset, so it's a good match for "Nottingham dataset" with a high score. For models, Flair NER and others are relevant, so they'll have high scores too.

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and the top candidates, ensuring the correct URIs and types are used. Since Nottingham isn't present, I'll use the most similar dataset and models from the context.
