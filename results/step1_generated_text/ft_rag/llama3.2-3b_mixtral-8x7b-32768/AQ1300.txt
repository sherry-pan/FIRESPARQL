Question:
What is the top benchmark score and its metric on the Atari 2600 Ice Hockey dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric?metric_lbl
     WHERE {
       orkgp:R123456 orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
       FILTER (str(?dataset) = "Atari 2600 Ice Hockey dataset")
      ?dataset orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?eval.
      ?eval orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
      ?metric rdfs:label?metric_lbl.
     }  

    Note that in the original problem, the dataset name was "MPQA", not "Atari 2600 Ice Hockey dataset", so you need to filter the dataset to match the actual dataset in the question.
