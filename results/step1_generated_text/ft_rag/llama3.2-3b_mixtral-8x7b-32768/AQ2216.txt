Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the LayerNorm HM-LSTM model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?code_ref
WHERE {
  orkgp:Model      a            orkgp:Model;
                  rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "LayerNorm HM-LSTM")
 ?model      orkgp:P31           ?cont.
 ?cont       orkgp:HAS_MODEL     ?model.
  OPTIONAL {?cont      orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?bench.}
  OPTIONAL {?cont      orkgp:HAS_CODE_REFERENCE     ?code_ref.}
}
``` 
    Note: The provided answer is based on the assumption that the provided SPARQL query is correct. In reality, the correct answer might vary depending on the actual data in the ORKG. 

    If you want to generate the SPARQL query yourself, you can use the provided input question and context to create the query. The general steps are as follows:
    1. Identify the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    2. Look up the candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    3. Use the identified entities and properties to construct a SPARQL query.
    4. Ensure that the query is correct and accurate based on the actual data in the ORKG. 

    Please note that this is a complex task and requires a good understanding of the ORKG, its data, and SPARQL queries. If you are not familiar with these topics, it's recommended to seek help from experts or use pre-built tools and services to generate the SPARQL query. 
    ``` 
``` 
    SELECT DISTINCT?code_ref
    WHERE {
      orkgp:Model      a            orkgp:Model;
                      rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
      FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "LayerNorm HM-LSTM")
     ?model      orkgp:P31           ?cont.
     ?cont       orkgp:HAS_MODEL     ?model.
      OPTIONAL {?cont      orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?bench.}
      OPTIONAL {?cont      orkgp:HAS_CODE_REFERENCE     ?code_ref.}
    }
    ``` 
    This SPARQL query selects all distinct code references in papers that have used the LayerNorm HM-LSTM model for benchmarking purposes. It filters the results to include only papers that have used the LayerNorm HM-LSTM model for benchmarking purposes. The query also selects all code references in papers that have used the LayerNorm HM-LSTM model for benchmarking
