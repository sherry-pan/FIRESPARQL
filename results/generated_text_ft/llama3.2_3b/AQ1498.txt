Question:
What is the best performing model benchmarking the PIQA dataset in terms of Accuracy metric?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg>
     PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/prop/direct/>
     PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
     SELECT?model?metric
     WHERE {
      ?model wdt:P3013 "PIQA dataset".
      ?model wdt:P3014?metric.
      ?metric rdfs:label "Accuracy".
      ?model wdt:P312 "Best performing".
      ?model wdt:P312?best_model.
       FILTER (STRONGER(?metric?metric)) 
       }
     ORDER BY (?metric?metric) 
     LIMIT 1
