Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Dmlab-30 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:hasDataset?dataset.
     FILTER (strLike(URI(?dataset) "http://orkg.org/orkg/dataset/dmlab-30").
    ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:hasMethod?method.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Titles?title.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Number?id.
     }
     }<|eot_id|>
