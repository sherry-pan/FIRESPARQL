Question:
What models are being evaluated on the TDMSci dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>

SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model orkgc:evaluatedOn?dataset.
  FILTER (?dataset rdfs:label = "MNIST"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string>).
}
``` 
    Note: The URIs used in the SPARQL query are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual URIs from the ORKG RDF data dump. The prefixes used are also placeholders and should be replaced with the actual prefixes used in the ORKG RDF data dump. The actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Note: The `^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string>` part is used to ensure that the literal value is correctly represented as a string. This is a common pattern when working with RDF data in SPARQL queries.

    Note: The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include the dataset "MNIST". This is a common pattern when working with RDF data in SPARQL queries. 

    Note: The `SELECT` clause is used to specify the variables that should be included in the results. In this case, we want to retrieve the model and dataset URIs. 

    Note: The `WHERE` clause is used to specify the conditions under which the query should return results. In this case, we want to retrieve the models that are evaluated on the MNIST dataset.
