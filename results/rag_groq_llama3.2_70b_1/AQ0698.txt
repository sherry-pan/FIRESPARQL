To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined in the query. 

First, we extract the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The question is about metrics used to evaluate models on the TDM Tagged Corpus dataset. The key entities and properties here are "metrics," "evaluate," "models," and "TDM Tagged Corpus dataset."

Next, we need to retrieve similar entities or properties from the given RDF data dump based on cosine similarity scores. Since the provided data dump is in Turtle format, we would typically parse this data into a form that can be processed for similarity calculations, such as vectors representing the entities and their descriptions.

However, given the constraints of this task and without direct access to external libraries or the ability to execute code, we'll proceed conceptually. We would calculate the cosine similarity between the vector representation of the question and the vector representations of entities and properties in the RDF data dump. This involves converting text into numerical vectors, often using techniques like word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe), and then computing the cosine similarity between these vectors.

Given the nature of the question and the typical content of RDF data dumps, we might expect entities related to "evaluation," "metrics," "models," and "datasets" to have high similarity scores. However, without specific details on the entities and properties in the RDF data dump beyond what's provided, we can only speculate on the exact matches.

For the purpose of this exercise, let's assume we've identified some entities and properties that could be relevant based on their labels and descriptions in the RDF data dump. We then calculate the cosine similarity between these and the question, sorting them by their scores.

Here's a hypothetical output based on the steps outlined, assuming we've found some relevant entities and properties:

```json
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R212134",
    "label": "Evaluation",
    "score": 0.85
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524",
    "label": "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire",
    "score": 0.78
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211922",
    "label": "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)",
    "score": 0.75
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211327",
    "label": "Component for template R206311",
    "score": 0.72
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R75840",
    "label": "Factors influencing evidence-based decision-making in humanitarian response",
    "score": 0.69
  }
]
```

This output lists entities with their URIs, labels, and similarity scores, assuming these entities were found to be the most similar to the question based on their descriptions and the cosine similarity metric. Note that the actual calculation of similarity scores and the identification of relevant entities would depend on the specifics of the RDF data dump and the implementation details of the similarity calculation.
