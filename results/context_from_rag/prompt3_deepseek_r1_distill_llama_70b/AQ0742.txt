Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question "What are the metrics of evaluation over the DuIE dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The question is asking about "metrics of evaluation" and the dataset mentioned is "DuIE. So, the key entities here are "DuIE dataset" and "evaluation metrics." The property that connects them is likely "evaluated on" or something similar.

Looking at the context data, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there are entries like <http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P39020> which seems to describe steps in a process. There are also resources like R147244 which has a value of 93.9, possibly an accuracy score. Then there are other resources like R147246 which mentions authors and publication details.

I need to find entities related to "DuIE dataset." In the context, I don't see any direct mention of "DuIE." However, there are mentions of datasets like "MNIST" in the steps, but that's not relevant here. Maybe "DuIE" isn't present, but I can look for any dataset-related resources.

Next, for "evaluation metrics," I should look for predicates or resources that describe evaluation. There's a resource R147244 with a value of 93.9, which could be an evaluation metric like accuracy. Also, there are predicates like P27 which mention authors, but that's not directly related.

I also notice that there are resources related to papers and publications, like R147246 and R283710, which have authors and years. But again, not directly related to evaluation metrics.

Since the context doesn't explicitly mention "DuIE dataset," I might have to infer or look for any dataset-related resources. Alternatively, maybe the dataset is referred to by another name or code in the context.

Looking at the structure, each resource has a URI, and some have labels. For example, R147244 has a value of 93.9, which could be a metric. R147246 has multiple authors and a year, which might be part of a publication that uses certain metrics.

I think the best approach is to list the resources that could be related to evaluation metrics, even if they aren't directly linked to "DuIE." So, R147244 with the value 93.9 is a candidate. Also, any predicates that describe evaluation, like P39020 which talks about steps, might be relevant.

In the end, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and the candidates, even if some are not perfect matches. I'll make sure to use the correct prefixes and include the necessary types.
