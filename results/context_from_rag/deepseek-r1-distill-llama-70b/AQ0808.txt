Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the SQuAD1.1 dataset. 

First, I know that SQuAD1.1 is a benchmark for question answering, and common metrics used include F1 score and EM (Exact Match). So I should look for properties related to these metrics.

Looking through the JSON, I see properties like "Exact Match" and "F1 Score". These seem directly relevant because they're standard evaluation metrics for SQuAD.

I also notice "Accuracy" and "Recall". While these are general metrics, they might not be as specific to SQuAD as F1 and EM, but they could still be used in some evaluations.

There's a "hasEvaluation" property, which is a bit broad but could encompass the specific metrics used.

I should list these properties, explaining why each is relevant. So, I'll include Exact Match, F1 Score, Accuracy, Recall, and hasEvaluation, each with a brief reason.

Here is the list of relevant properties from the JSON file that could help answer the question about the metrics used to evaluate models on the SQuAD1.1 benchmark dataset:

```json
[
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71079",
    "label": "Recall",
    "reason": "Recall is a common metric used in evaluating question answering tasks."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71080",
    "label": "micro-F1",
    "reason": "F1 score is a key metric for evaluating question answering models."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71081",
    "label": "Accuracy",
    "reason": "Accuracy is a fundamental metric for evaluating model performance."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71082",
    "label": "macro-F1",
    "reason": "Macro-F1 provides a more comprehensive evaluation of model performance across different categories."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71075",
    "label": "hasEvaluation",
    "reason": "This property indicates the presence of evaluation metrics, which is directly relevant to the question."
  }
]
```
