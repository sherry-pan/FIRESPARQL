Question:
Can you provide the highest benchmark result, including the metric and score, for the AAPD dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?metric?score WHERE {
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasMetric?metric.
 ?dataset ora:hasScore?score.
  FILTER (?metric = "metric" AND?score = "score" AND?dataset = "AAPD_dataset" )
}
``` 
    Note that the output SPARQL query is not necessarily the optimal query, but rather a query that can be used to retrieve the answer to the input question based on the provided context. The optimal query may require additional information or a different approach.<|eot_id|>
