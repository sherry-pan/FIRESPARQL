Okay, I need to figure out the most relevant properties from the given JSON file that correspond to the question about evaluation metrics over the iNaturalist 2019 dataset. Let me start by understanding the question. It's asking about the metrics used to evaluate something, probably a model or method, on the iNaturalist 2019 dataset.

Looking at the JSON example, I see a list of properties with their labels. The task is to pick the ones that relate to evaluation metrics. So, I should focus on properties that are about evaluation, benchmarks, or specific metrics like accuracy or F1 scores.

First, I notice a property with the label "evaluation". That seems directly relevant because the question is about evaluation metrics. The IRI is "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_EVALUATION", so that's a good candidate.

Next, there's a property labeled "has benchmark". Benchmarks are often used to evaluate models, so this could relate to the metrics used. The IRI is "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_BENCHMARK".

I also see properties like "Accuracy", "Recall", "macro-F1", and "micro-F1". These are specific evaluation metrics. For example, "Accuracy" is a common metric, so the property with label "Accuracy" and IRI "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71081" would be relevant.

Similarly, "Recall" is another key metric, so the property with that label and IRI "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71079" should be included.

For F1 scores, both "macro-F1" and "micro-F1" are important. Their IRIs are "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71082" and "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71080" respectively.

I should also consider if there are any other relevant properties, but from the list, these seem to cover the main evaluation metrics. So, I'll compile these into the required format, explaining why each is relevant.
