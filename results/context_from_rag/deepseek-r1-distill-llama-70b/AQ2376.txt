Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question about listing papers that used the ANODE model and include code links. 

First, the question is asking for papers, so I should look for properties related to publications or research. The JSON has properties like "has benchmark", "evaluation", "method", "implementation", and "dataset". 

"Has benchmark" might be useful because benchmarks often involve comparing different models, and if ANODE was used in a benchmark, it would be listed there. 

"Evaluation" is another good candidate since papers usually evaluate their models, and if ANODE was part of that evaluation, it would be mentioned here.

"Method" is relevant because ANODE is a specific method or model, so any paper using it would list it under their methods section.

"Implementation" is important because it often includes code or links to repositories where the code is hosted, which is exactly what the question is asking for.

"Has dataset" might be useful if the papers used specific datasets with ANODE, but it's a bit less directly related to the code links.

So, I'll select these properties as they cover both the identification of papers using ANODE and the inclusion of code links through implementations.
