Question:
List the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the Penn Treebank (Word Level) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?title?id 
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:isOver?dataset.
 ?dataset ora:isDataset "http://www.nltk.org/datasets/wordnet".
  FILTER (lang(?title) = "en" AND lang(?id) = "en" )
}
```    END Sparql Query    END
```

    Please note that the SPARQL query is generated based on the structured response provided earlier. It queries the ORKG for research papers with a benchmark over the Penn Treebank dataset, filtering the results to include only English titles and IDs. The query uses the `ora:ResearchPaper`, `ora:hasBenchmark`, `ora:isOver`, and `ora:isDataset` predicates to link the relevant entities. The `FILTER` clause ensures that only English titles and IDs are returned. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to work with the ORKG RDF data dump, which is assumed to contain the necessary resources and properties. The query may need to be modified or extended to accommodate any specific requirements or changes in the ORKG data. 

    Please note that this is a generated query and may not be the most efficient or optimal query for the given use case. It is intended to demonstrate how to construct a SPARQL query based on the provided structured response. 

    To execute the query, you can use a SPARQL query engine or a tool that supports SPARQL queries. The query can be executed against the ORKG RDF data dump to retrieve the relevant research papers and their corresponding titles and IDs. 

    The output of the query will be a set of RDF triples, where each triple represents a research paper with its title and ID. The `?paper` variable represents the research paper, `?title` represents the title, and `?id` represents the ID. The query returns the results in English, as specified by the `lang` function. 

    The query may return multiple results, depending on the number of research papers that match the specified criteria. Each result will include the title and ID of the research paper, as well as the relevant metadata and properties. 

    Please note that the query is designed to work with the ORKG RDF data dump, which is assumed to contain the necessary resources and properties. The query may need to be modified or extended to accommodate any specific requirements or changes in the ORKG data. 

    To optimize the query, you can consider using indexing, caching, or other query optimization techniques to improve performance. 

    The query can be executed using a variety of tools and platforms, including SPARQL query engines, data management systems, and web applications. The specific tool or platform used will depend on the requirements and constraints of the use case.
