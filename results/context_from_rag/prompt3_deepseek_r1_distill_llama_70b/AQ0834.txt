Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Can you list the metrics used to evaluate models on the QNLI dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "metrics" and "QNLI dataset". The property mentioned is "evaluate models on". So, I'm looking for metrics related to evaluating models, specifically on the QNLI dataset.

Next, I need to find similar entities or properties in the RDF data. Looking through the context, I see that there are various resources and predicates. For example, there are mentions of "HAS_VALUE" and "P39020" which seem to be related to steps or values. However, I don't see any direct mentions of "metrics" or "QNLI dataset" in the provided context. 

Wait, maybe I can infer some connections. The context talks about steps involving NER approaches and CRF algorithms, which might relate to evaluation metrics. Also, there are resources like R147652 which describe steps, and R283709 which mentions "method" and "solution proposal". 

Since the question is about metrics used for evaluation on a specific dataset, I should look for any predicates or resources that indicate evaluation or metrics. In the context, I see that R147244 has a HAS_VALUE of "93.9", which could be a metric. Also, R283709 mentions "method" and "solution proposal", which might be related to evaluation methods.

I also notice that there are various papers mentioned with authors and years, but I'm not sure how they relate to metrics. Maybe the papers discuss evaluation methods, but without more context, it's hard to tell.

So, for the term "metrics", I can consider resources that have values or are related to evaluation. For "QNLI dataset", since it's not directly mentioned, I might look for similar datasets or any dataset-related resources. However, in the provided data, I don't see QNLI, but there's MNIST mentioned in step 1. Maybe I can use that as a similar dataset.

Putting this together, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and the candidates. For "metrics", I'll include resources that have values or are related to evaluation steps. For "QNLI dataset", I'll look for any dataset resources, even if they're not QNLI specifically. For "evaluate models on", I'll include predicates that relate to evaluation or testing.

I need to make sure to use the correct RDF prefixes and include the types. Since the context doesn't have exact matches, the candidates might be a bit general, but I'll do my best with the available data.
