Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the MPAD-path model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkgr#>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp#>

SELECT?paper?code
WHERE {
 ?paper orkg:has_model orkg:R122689.
 ?paper orkg:has_code?code.
  SERVICE orkg:search {
    BIND(strcat("WHERE ", iri(?paper), " orkg:has_model orkg:R122689") AS?query).
    BIND(strcat("  AND ", iri(?paper), " orkg:has_code?code") AS?query).
    BIND(strcat("  AND?query") AS?query).
   ?result orkg:search(?query).
    BIND(strcat(" ?result", " orkg:has_model orkg:R122689") AS?query).
    BIND(strcat(" ?result", " orkg:has_code?code") AS?query).
  }
}
``` 
    Note: The actual SPARQL query may require modifications based on the actual data in the ORKG. The above query is just a sample query based on the provided context and question. 

    Note: The `iri` function is used to convert the string representation of the URI to a URI literal. The `strcat` function is used to concatenate strings. The `?paper` and `?code` variables are used to store the values of the `paper` and `code` variables in the query. 

    Note: The `orkg:search` service is used to search for the papers that match the specified conditions. The `?result` variable is used to store the results of the search. 

    Note: The `?paper` and `?code` variables are used to store the values of the `paper` and `code` variables in the query. 

    Note: The `strcat` function is used to concatenate strings. The `?paper` and `?code` variables are used to store the values of the `paper` and `code` properties in the query. 

    Note: The `?paper` and `?code` variables are used to store the values of the `paper` and `code` properties in the query. 

    Note: The `?paper` and `?code` variables are used to store the values of the `paper` and `code` properties in the query.
