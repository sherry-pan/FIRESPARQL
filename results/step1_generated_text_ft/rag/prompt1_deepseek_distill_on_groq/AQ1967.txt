Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the Flair-TDM model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information to find any mentions of papers. I see several resources labeled as "Paper" in the context. For example, R211524 is a paper titled "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire." Another one is R211922, titled "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)." There's also R211327, which is a paper but the label isn't provided in the context. 

Next, I need to check if any of these papers mention the Flair-TDM model. Looking through the context, I don't see any direct mention of "Flair-TDM." However, R211922's title includes "Named Entities and Morphology," which might relate to named entity recognition, a task where Flair-TDM could be applied. 

Since the context doesn't explicitly mention Flair-TDM, I can't confirm which papers used it. But I can list the papers I found and note that without more information, I can't determine their use of Flair-TDM. 

I also need to include links to their code, but the context doesn't provide any URLs or links. So, I'll mention that the code links aren't available in the provided data.

Finally, I'll structure the answer as a JSON list of dictionaries, each containing the URI, label, and a score. Since I can't calculate cosine similarity without more data, I'll assign a placeholder score of 0.0 to each.

To address the query, I extracted the entities and properties from the question, focusing on papers related to the Flair-TDM model. However, the context provided doesn't mention Flair-TDM or include code links. Here's the structured response based on the available data:

```json
[
    {
        "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524",
        "label": "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire",
        "score": 0.0
    },
    {
        "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211922",
        "label": "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)",
        "score": 0.0
    },
    {
        "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211327",
        "label": "Paper",
        "score": 0.0
    }
]
```

This response lists the papers found in the context, noting that the Flair-TDM model and code links aren't mentioned.
