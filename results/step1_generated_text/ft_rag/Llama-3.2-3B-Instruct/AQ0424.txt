Question:
List the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the WMT2014 German-English dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a            orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label   ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WMT2014 German-English")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                       orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
      ?eval           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?benchmark      rdfs:label              ?benchmark_lbl.
      ?cont         orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?cont         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
      ?paper        orkgp:HAS_SOURCE        ?cont.
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(?eval)
     LIMIT 5
``` 
    The SPARQL query is designed to answer the question by selecting the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the WMT2014 German-English dataset. The query starts by identifying the dataset with the label "WMT2014 German-English" and then filters the results to only include papers that have a benchmark over this dataset. The query then selects the title of each paper and returns the top 5 results. 

    Please note that the query is designed to work with the provided context, but it may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure and content of the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Also, note that the query is case-sensitive and may not work as expected if the dataset labels or other text are not in lowercase. 

    You can adjust the query to fit the actual structure and content of the data, but it should generally follow the same logic and steps outlined in the provided context. 

    Please let me know if you need any further assistance or if you have any questions about the query. 

    Here is the SPARQL query with the correct syntax:
     ```sparql
     SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a            orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label   ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WMT2014 German-English")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                       orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
      ?eval           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?benchmark      rdfs:label              ?benchmark_lbl.
      ?cont         orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?cont         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
      ?paper        orkgp:HAS_SOURCE        ?cont.
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(?eval)
     LIMIT 5
     ``` 
    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like any further assistance.
