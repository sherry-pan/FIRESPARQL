Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The user is asking for a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the NCBI-disease dataset. 

First, I'll look through the context information. The context includes several RDF triples from an ORKG dump. I see that there are two main resources mentioned: R147246 and R283710. Each of these seems to represent a research paper or publication.

Looking at R147246, it has several properties. The P27 predicate lists the authors: Ligia Sierra, Betty L LÃ³pez, Flavio Forni, Maria Angela Vandelli, Michele Zoli, and Antonietta Vilella. The P29 indicates the year is 2015, and P28 shows the volume number 6. There's also a HAS_VALUE of 93.9, which might be related to some metric or score.

For R283710, the authors are Yuanyuan Wu, Mengxing Huang, Zhaocheng Tu, and Siling Feng. The year is 2021, volume 8. The P3000 lists keywords like Graph analytics, Horizon 2020, Keyphrase extraction, Knowledge graph, Named entity recognition, etc. This paper seems to be about entity extraction using various techniques.

Now, the user is asking about papers that benchmarked models on the NCBI-disease dataset. I don't see any direct mention of the NCBI-disease dataset in the context. The papers mentioned here discuss topics like entity extraction, keyphrase extraction, and graph analytics, but not specifically the NCBI-disease dataset.

Since the context doesn't provide information about the NCBI-disease dataset or any papers benchmarking models on it, I can't extract any relevant terms or candidates from the given data. Therefore, the candidates for each extracted term will be empty.

The context provided does not contain any information related to the NCBI-disease dataset or research papers that benchmarked models on it. Therefore, no relevant candidates can be extracted.
