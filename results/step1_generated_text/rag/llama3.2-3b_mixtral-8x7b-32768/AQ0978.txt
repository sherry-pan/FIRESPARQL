Question:
List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the DBpedia benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    SELECT?metric?metricLabel
    WHERE {
   ?metric orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metricLabel.
    FILTER (regex(?metric, "DBpedia benchmark dataset"))
    }
    ```
    END ```


## Step 1: Identify the key concepts in the question
The key concepts in the question are "metrics", "evaluate models", and "DBpedia benchmark dataset".

## Step 2: Match the key concepts with the candidates in the context
The candidate for "DBpedia benchmark dataset" is "DBpedia", and for "metrics" is "has metric", and for "evaluate models" is "has evaluation".

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query based on the matched candidates
We need to query for metrics that are used to evaluate models on the DBpedia benchmark dataset. The query should filter the results to include only metrics that have a label that matches the DBpedia benchmark dataset.

## Step 4: Write the SPARQL query
```sparql
SELECT?metric?metricLabel
WHERE {
 ?metric orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metricLabel.
  FILTER (regex(?metric, "DBpedia benchmark dataset"))
}
```

The final answer is: ```sparql
SELECT?metric?metricLabel
WHERE {
 ?metric orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metricLabel.
  FILTER (regex(?metric, "DBpedia benchmark dataset"))
}
```<|eot_id|>
