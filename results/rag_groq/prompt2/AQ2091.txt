Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking for links to code used in papers that benchmark the Multi-Perspective Matching (single model) model. 

First, I'll break down the query. The key terms here are "papers," "benchmark," "Multi-Perspective Matching (single model)," and "code links." So, I need to extract these terms and find related entities and properties in the context.

Looking at the context, I see two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a method with five steps, including using SciBERT and k-means for expansion, CRF for NER, and filtering. R284316 is a journal article about extracting entity knowledge using a model called jpark, which uses tools like Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight. It also mentions a DOI link.

I need to extract terms from the query. "Papers" would relate to research articles, "benchmark" relates to evaluation methods, "Multi-Perspective Matching" is a specific model, and "code links" would be URLs or DOIs.

Next, I'll compute similarity. The context doesn't have "Multi-Perspective Matching," but R284316's paper is about entity extraction and uses several tools. The DOI link here is a match for "code links." So, the paper in R284316 is relevant.

For "benchmark," R147652's method involves evaluation steps, so that's a match. "Papers" would correspond to R284316 and R147246, which are both journal articles.

Now, selecting top candidates. For "papers," R284317 is a journal article with a DOI, which is a code link. For "benchmark," R147652's steps are about evaluation. "Multi-Perspective Matching" isn't directly present, but R284316's jpark model is about entity extraction, which is somewhat related. "Code links" directly match the DOI in R284317.

I'll structure the JSON accordingly, grouping the candidates under each extracted term with their scores based on relevance.
