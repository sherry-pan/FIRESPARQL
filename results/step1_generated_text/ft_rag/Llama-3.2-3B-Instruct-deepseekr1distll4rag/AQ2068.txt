Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the DCN model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code,?paper
     WHERE {
      ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
                 rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "DCN")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?cont           orkgp:P31               ?paper.
      ?code          orkgp:P32               ?code.
     }
     LIMIT 5
```


Please note that the outputted SPARQL query is based on the provided context and the question. It's assumed that the RDF data is correctly formatted and available in the ORKG repository. The query is designed to find code references in papers that have used the DCN model for benchmarking purposes. The `LIMIT 5` clause is used to restrict the output to the top 5 similar entities.<|eot_id|>
