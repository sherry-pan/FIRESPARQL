 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?link
WHERE {
 ?paper a orkg:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper orkg:hasLink?link.
  filter(contains(str(?link), "https://"))
 ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkg:hasModel?model.
 ?model orkg:isSimilarTo "GCN_Hybrid_model".
}
```    Note: The above SPARQL query is a simplified example and may not cover all the nuances of the provided context. It's intended to demonstrate the format of the SPARQL query based on the given JSON output.<|eot_id|>
