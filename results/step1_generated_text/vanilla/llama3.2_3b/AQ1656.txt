    Note: 
    The SPARQL query is generated using the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) ontology and schema.org vocabulary. 
    The query is designed to retrieve the best performing model for the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset in terms of FLOPS metric. 
    The query uses the `ORKG` namespace to access the knowledge graph, and the `Schema.org` vocabulary to describe the metrics and benchmarks. 
    The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include the best performing model and the maximum FLOPS value. 
    The `STRIKE` function is used to rank the models and metrics based on their performance. 
    The query returns two variables: `?model` and `?metric`, which represent the best performing model and the corresponding metric, respectively. 

    Please note that the generated SPARQL query is an example and may need to be modified to accommodate specific use cases or data availability. 

    The SPARQL query is based on the assumption that the knowledge graph contains the necessary data to answer the question. If the data is not available, the query may not return any results. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to be executed on a SPARQL query engine, such as SPARQLQuery or SPARQLQuery2, to retrieve the results.
