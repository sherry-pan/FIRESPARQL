Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Funnel Transformer model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
      ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
                 rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "Funnel Transformer")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                       orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
     }```


    This SPARQL query will return the code links for papers that use the Funnel Transformer model. The `FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "Funnel Transformer")` line ensures that only papers with the Funnel Transformer model are returned. 

    If there were papers that used the Funnel Transformer model, this query would return the code links for those papers. However, since the context does not contain any information about the Funnel Transformer model, the query will return an empty list. 

    If you want to get a list of papers that use the Funnel Transformer model, you would need to add additional context that mentions the model. 

    Also, please note that the `?model_lbl` variable is used to get the label of the model. This is because the model is represented as a resource in the RDF data, and we need to get its label to filter the results. 

    The `str(?model_lbl) = "Funnel Transformer"` filter is used to check if the label of the model is equal to "Funnel Transformer". This is done to ensure that only papers that use the exact model are returned. 

    The `?cont?cont orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE?code` part of the query is used to get the source code links for the papers. 

    The `DISTINCT` keyword is used to return only unique code links. 

    Please note that this query assumes that the RDF data is in the same format as the provided context. If the RDF data is in a different format, the query may need to be modified accordingly. 

    Also, please note that the `?model_lbl` variable is assumed to be a string. If the label of the model is not a string, the query may need to be modified accordingly. 

    Finally, please note that the `FILTER` function is used to filter the results. The `str(?model_lbl) = "Funnel Transformer"` filter is used to check if the label of the model is equal to "Funnel Transformer". This filter is used to ensure that only papers that use the exact model are returned.
