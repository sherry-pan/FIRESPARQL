Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the WOS-46985 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?title?title_lbl (SELECT?paper_lbl FROM?paper?paper_lbl)
    WHERE {
      orkgp:R1 orkgp:P36 orkgp:P37?benchmark
      FILTER (str(?benchmark) = "WOS-46985")
     ?benchmark orkgp:P37?dataset
     ?dataset orkgp:P34?cont
     ?cont orkgp:P33?paper
     ?paper orkgp:P35?title
     ?title rdfs:label?title_lbl
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_ID?paper_id
     ?paper_id rdfs:label?paper_lbl
    }  

```python
SELECT?title?title_lbl (SELECT?paper_lbl FROM?paper?paper_lbl)
WHERE {
  orkgp:R1 orkgp:P36 orkgp:P37?benchmark
  FILTER (str(?benchmark) = "WOS-46985")
 ?benchmark orkgp:P37?dataset
 ?dataset orkgp:P34?cont
 ?cont orkgp:P33?paper
 ?paper orkgp:P35?title
 ?title rdfs:label?title_lbl
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_ID?paper_id
 ?paper_id rdfs:label?paper_lbl
}
```

Note: The above code is not intended to be run as a Python script, but rather as a direct translation of the provided SPARQL query. The purpose of this code is to generate the SPARQL query based on the provided input question and context. 

However, to maintain the required format, the code is presented in a Pythonic way with a function that takes the question and context as input. The function returns the generated SPARQL query as a string.

Here is the code:

```python
def generate_sparql_query(question, context):
    query = "SELECT?title?title_lbl (SELECT?paper_lbl FROM?paper?paper_lbl)\n"
    query += "WHERE {\
