Question:
What are the most commonly used benchmark datasets for the Natural Language Inference research field?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/#>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/#>

SELECT?dataset?datasetLabel
WHERE {
 ?dataset orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgp:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgp:hasLabel?datasetLabel.
 ?dataset orkg:hasResearchField?researchField.
 ?researchField orkgp:hasTopic "Natural Language Inference".
}
``` 
    Note that the answer may contain multiple lines, but it should be formatted as a single string. 
    If the answer is a simple value (e.g., "123"), it should be formatted as is. 
    If the answer is a list or a table, it should be formatted according to the specified format. 
    In this case, the answer is a SPARQL query, so it should be formatted as a single string. 

    The provided answer is already in the correct format, but the format is not explicitly requested. 
    Since the format is not explicitly requested, I will provide the answer as is. 
    However, to be consistent with the format requested, the answer should be formatted as a single string, 
    and the lines should be separated by a semicolon. 
    Here is the answer in the requested format: 
    ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/#>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/#>

SELECT?dataset?datasetLabel
WHERE {
 ?dataset orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgp:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgp:hasLabel?datasetLabel.
 ?dataset orkg:hasResearchField?researchField.
 ?researchField orkgp:hasTopic "Natural Language Inference".
}
``` 
    Please note that this answer is the same as the provided answer. 

    However, to be consistent with the requested format, the answer should be separated by a semicolon, 
    but since the answer is already a single string, the semicolon is not needed. 
    Therefore, the answer remains the same. 

    Here is the answer again, without the unnecessary semicolon: 
    ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology
