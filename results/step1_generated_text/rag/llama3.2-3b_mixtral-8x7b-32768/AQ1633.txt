    PREFIX orkgr: <http://orkgr.org/schema/ontology/>
    SELECT?model?score?dataset
    WHERE {
   ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?m.
   ?m orkgp:HAS_SCORE?s.
   ?s orkgr:R122689?ds.
   ?m orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?b.
   ?b orkgr:R122689?ds.
   ?ds orkgp:HAS_DATASET?d.
    FILTER (MAX(?s) =?s)
    }
    ```
    If you want to know the answer to the question, run the above SPARQL query against the ORKG. The answer will be the model that has achieved the highest Score score on the Reacher, easy (DMControl500k) benchmark dataset.
