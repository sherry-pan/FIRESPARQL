Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the Rational DQN Average model?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
     PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/ontology/#>
     SELECT?paper?code 
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:relatedTo?benchmarkPaper.
    ?benchmarkPaper wdt:P275?benchmarkCode.
    ?benchmarkPaper dbo:hasSource?benchmarkSource.
    ?benchmarkSource wdt:P106?code.
    ?paper orkg:hasCode?code.
     FILTER (STR(?benchmarkCode) = "Rational DQN Average")
     } 
    Note: The above SPARQL query is not exhaustive and may need to be modified to fit the actual data in the ORKG. 
    Also, the query assumes that the'relatedTo' property is used to represent the 'citedBy' relationship, and that the 'hasCode' property is used to represent the 'hasCode' property. 
    These assumptions may not be correct and may need to be adjusted based on the actual data in the ORKG. 

    This query is designed to return a list of papers that benchmark the Rational DQN Average model, along with the code used in those papers. 
    The query first finds papers that are related to the benchmark papers, then finds the code used in those benchmark papers, and finally filters the results to only include papers that have the Rational DQN Average code. 
    The?code variable is used to store the code used in the benchmark papers, and the?paper variable is used to store the paper that has the code. 

    This query is a simple example of how to generate a SPARQL query from a natural language question. 
    In a real-world application, you would need to consider factors such as handling ambiguity and uncertainty in the question, 
    as well as optimizing the query for performance and scalability. 

    To generate a SPARQL query from a natural language question, you can follow these steps:
    1. Tokenize the question into individual words.
    2. Identify the entities and relationships in the question.
    3. Generate a SPARQL query based on the entities and relationships identified in step 2. 
    4. Optimize the query for performance and scalability. 
    5. Test the query to ensure it returns the correct results.
