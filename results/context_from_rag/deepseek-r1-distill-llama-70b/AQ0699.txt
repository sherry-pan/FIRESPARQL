Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the CommonsenseQA benchmark dataset. The question is about listing the metrics used, so I should look for properties related to evaluation, metrics, or performance measurement.

Looking through the JSON, I see properties like "evaluation", "Accuracy", "Recall", "macro-F1", "micro-F1", etc. These all seem like standard evaluation metrics. "evaluation" is a general term that could encompass various metrics, so that's definitely relevant. "Accuracy" measures how often the model is correct, which is a common metric. "Recall" is about how well the model finds all relevant instances, which is important in QA tasks. Both "macro-F1" and "micro-F1" are F1 scores, which combine precision and recall, providing a balanced measure.

I also notice "NDCG@10", which stands for Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at position 10. This metric is used to evaluate ranking quality, which is relevant for QA tasks where models might rank answers. "hasEvaluation" seems like a higher-level property indicating that an evaluation has been performed, so it's also relevant.

Other properties like "Avg Characters" or "Avg words" are more about data characteristics rather than evaluation metrics, so I can exclude those. Similarly, properties related to the dataset structure, like "columns" or "rows", aren't directly metrics.

So, the most relevant properties are the ones that directly correspond to evaluation metrics or the evaluation process itself. These include "evaluation", "Accuracy", "Recall", "macro-F1", "micro-F1", "NDCG@10", and "hasEvaluation".

The most relevant properties from the JSON file that correspond to evaluating models on the CommonsenseQA benchmark dataset are those related to evaluation metrics and processes. These include general evaluation terms, accuracy measures, recall, F1 scores, ranking metrics, and indicators of evaluation processes.
