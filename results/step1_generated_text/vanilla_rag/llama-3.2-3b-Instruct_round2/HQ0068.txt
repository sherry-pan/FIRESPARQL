Question:
Which sectors are modeled as energy sectors and how often?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?sector?frequency
     WHERE {
      ?s a orkg:Sector.
      ?s orkg:sector?sector.
      ?s orkg:energy?energy.
      ?s orkg:frequency?frequency.
       FILTER (?energy = "energy" &&?sector = "energy sector" )
     }<|eot_id|>
