Okay, I need to figure out where the study with the maximal geographic scale took place based on the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me start by understanding the question. The user is asking about the location of a study that has the largest geographic scope.

First, I'll look through the context information to find relevant data. The context has two main sections, each containing triples about different resources. 

Looking at the first section, I see that resource R147246 has several properties. The P27 predicate lists authors: Ligia Sierra, Betty L LÃ³pez, Flavio Forni, Maria Angela Vandelli, Michele Zoli, and Antonietta Vilella. The P29 predicate indicates the year as 2015, and P28 shows the volume number as 6. There's also a HAS_VENUE predicate linking to R147247, but I don't see the venue's details here.

In the second section, resource R284317 has similar properties. The P27 predicate lists authors Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta. The P29 is 2021, P28 is 11, and HAS_VENUE links to R284318. Additionally, there's a url predicate with a DOI link and a P26 predicate with the same DOI. The P5044 indicates it's a Journal Article, and the wikidata:P17 points to "Italy".

So, the key here is the wikidata:P17 predicate, which in the second resource is set to "Italy". This suggests that the study associated with R284317 took place in Italy. Since the question is about the maximal geographic scale, and Italy is a country, it's likely that this study has a broader geographic scope compared to others, which might be confined to smaller regions or institutions.

I don't see any other resources in the context with a country-level location. Therefore, the study with the maximal geographic scale is associated with resource R284317, which is located in Italy.

The study with the maximal geographic scale took place in Italy. This is indicated by the resource R284317, which has the property wikidata:P17 set to "Italy".
