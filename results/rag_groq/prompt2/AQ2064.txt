Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The query is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the SAN (single) model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of papers or models related to SAN. The context has two main sections, each describing a resource. 

Looking at the first resource, R147652, it describes a method involving steps for named entity recognition. It mentions using a CRF algorithm and terms like SVM and MNIST. There's no mention of SAN here.

The second resource, R284316, is about a journal article titled "validation research" and "technique." It discusses extracting entity knowledge using a model called jpark, which involves NER and EL tools. Again, no mention of SAN.

Since neither resource mentions the SAN model, there are no relevant papers or code links to provide. Therefore, the candidates list will be empty for both "papers" and "SAN model."

```json
{
  "question": "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the SAN (single) model and include the links to their code?",
  "extracted_terms": [
    {
      "rdfs:label": "papers",
      "type": "Class",
      "rdf:type": "rdfs:Class"
    },
    {
      "rdfs:label": "SAN (single) model",
      "type": "Model",
      "rdf:type": "orkgc:Resource"
    },
    {
      "rdfs:label": "links to their code",
      "type": "Property",
      "rdf:type": "orkgp:Predicate"
    }
  ],
  "candidates": {
    "papers": [],
    "SAN (single) model": [],
    "links to their code": []
  }
}
```
