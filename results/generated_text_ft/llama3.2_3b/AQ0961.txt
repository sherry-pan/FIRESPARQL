Question:
What are the metrics of evaluation over the Atari 2600 Frostbite dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearch.org/orkg/>

     SELECT?metric?metricLabel 
     WHERE {
      ?s orkg:hasMetric?m.
      ?m orkg:hasMetricLabel?ml.
      ?s orkg:hasDataset "Atari 2600 Frostbite".
      ?m orkg:hasMetricLabel?ml.
       FILTER (STRLIKE(STR(?m), "accuracy") || STRLIKE(STR(?m), "loss") || STRLIKE(STR(?m), "reward"))
     } 
     GROUP BY?m?ml 
     HAVING COUNT(?s) >= 2 
     ORDER BY DESC(STR(?m))
     LIMIT 1
     OFFSET 0
    END{ }

Note that I've left out the implementation of the `generate_sparql_query` function, as it's not provided in the original code snippet. You'll need to fill in the implementation based on the requirements of your project.<|eot_id|>
