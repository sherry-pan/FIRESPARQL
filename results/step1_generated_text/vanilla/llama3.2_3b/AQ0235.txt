    The Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) is a semantic knowledge graph designed to represent, 
    compare, and retrieve scholarly contributions. Given a natural language question in English, your task 
    is to generate the corresponding SPARQL query to this question. The generated SPARQL query should be 
    able to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question.
