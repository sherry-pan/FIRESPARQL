Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The user is asking for a list of papers that used the BERT + BiLSTM + CRF Decoding model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of papers. I see several resources labeled as "Paper" such as R211524, R211922, R211327, and others. Each of these has a label which is the title of the paper.

Next, I need to check if any of these papers mention the specific model the user is asking about. The model in question is BERT + BiLSTM + CRF Decoding. Looking at the context, I don't see any explicit mention of this model in the paper titles or labels. 

Since the context doesn't provide information about the model used in each paper, I can't directly link any of the papers to the BERT + BiLSTM + CRF setup. Therefore, I can't retrieve any relevant papers based on the given data.

I should inform the user that, based on the provided context, there's no information available about papers using that specific model. I'll structure the answer to reflect that no relevant entities were found.

The provided context does not contain information about papers that utilized the BERT + BiLSTM + CRF Decoding model or links to their code. Therefore, no relevant entities or properties could be retrieved.
