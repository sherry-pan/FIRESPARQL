Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the UCF101 (finetuned) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkg/>
     PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
     SELECT?metric?dataset 
     WHERE {
     ?metric orkgc:relatedTo?evaluation_method.
     ?evaluation_method orkgp:hasProperty?benchmarking_property.
     ?benchmarking_property orkgc:hasValue?benchmarking_value.
     ?benchmarking_value orkgp:hasTarget?benchmarking_target.
     ?benchmarking_target orkgc:relatedTo?dataset.
     ?dataset a orkgc:Dataset.
      FILTER (STRLIKE(STR(?metric), "validation research") || STRLIKE(STR(?metric), "performance assessment")).
      FILTER (STRLIKE(STR(?dataset), "UCF101") || STRLIKE(STR(?dataset), "MNIST"))
    }
    Note: the actual SPARQL query would depend on the actual RDF data dump, which is not provided here. The above query is just an example based on the provided context. 

```sql
-- Assuming a table 'orkgr' with the following columns:
--   - id
--   - rdfs:label
--   - uri
--   - type
--   - rdf:type

SELECT 
    m1.rdfs:label AS metric,
    d1.rdfs:label AS dataset
FROM 
    orkgr AS m1
JOIN 
    orkgr AS d1 ON m1.rdfs:label = 'evaluation metrics' AND d1.type = 'Dataset'
JOIN 
    orkgr AS e ON m1.rdfs:label = 'evaluation metrics' AND e.type = 'Metric'
JOIN 
    orkgr AS b ON e.rdfs:label = 'benchmarking models on' AND b.type = 'Property'
JOIN 
    orkgr AS v ON b.rdfs:label = 'benchmarking models on' AND v.type = 'Metric'
JOIN 
    orkgr AS d ON v.rdfs:label = 'benchmarking models on' AND d.type = 'Dataset'
WHERE 
    (m1.rdfs:label LIKE '%validation research%' OR m1.rdfs:label LIKE '%performance assessment%')
    AND (d1.rdfs:label LIKE '%UCF101%' OR d1.rdfs:label LIKE '%MNIST%');

    The final answer is the SPARQL query provided above. 

    This response was generated using the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) semantic knowledge graph and the provided context. The goal is to generate a SPARQL query that can be used to query the ORKG and retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the evaluation metrics and datasets that are commonly used when benchmarking models on the UCF101 (finetuned) dataset. The query uses the `relatedTo` and `hasProperty` predicates to link the evaluation metrics to the benchmarking models, and the `hasValue` and `hasTarget` predicates to link the benchmarking models to the datasets. The query also uses filters to ensure that the retrieved metrics and datasets are related to the UCF101 dataset or the MNIST dataset. 

    The actual SPARQL query would depend on the actual RDF data dump, which is not provided here. The above query is just an example based on the provided context. 

    The provided context includes information about the ORKG RDF data dump, the RDF predicates, and the types of resources. It also includes information about the evaluation metrics, datasets, and benchmarking models. 

    The context also includes information about the relationships between the resources, such as the `relatedTo` and `hasProperty` predicates. It also includes information about the types of resources, such as the `Metric` and `Dataset` types. 

    The context also includes information about the filtering conditions, such as the `STRLIKE` function, which is used to filter the metrics and datasets based on their labels.
