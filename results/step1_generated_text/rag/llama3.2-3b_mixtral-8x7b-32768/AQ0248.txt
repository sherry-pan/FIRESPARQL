Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the Atari 2600 Assault dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
```sql
SELECT?m
WHERE {
 ?m a ora:Model.
 ?m ora:hasDataset?d.
 ?d ora:hasDataset?a.
 ?a ora:hasEvaluation?e.
  FILTER (STR(?e) = "Atari 2600 Assault")
}
```
    Note: ora and ora are placeholders for the actual namespaces used in the ORKG. You should replace them with the actual namespace URIs.
```
    If there is no match, provide a message indicating that there is no match.
```
    Note: The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve models that have been evaluated on the specified dataset. The query uses the `ora:Model` class to identify models, `ora:hasDataset` to link models to datasets, `ora:hasDataset` again to link datasets to the specified dataset, `ora:hasEvaluation` to link evaluations to datasets, and a filter to ensure that the evaluation matches the specified dataset. The query returns the models that have been evaluated on the specified dataset.
```
```
    There is no match.
