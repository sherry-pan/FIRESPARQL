To answer the given question, we first need to extract the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The question is: "What are the models that have been benchmarked on the ACE 2005 dataset?" 

The entities and properties mentioned in the question are:
- Models
- ACE 2005 dataset
- Benchmark

Next, we need to retrieve the top 10 similar entities or properties from the given RDF data dump based on cosine similarity scores. 

After analyzing the given RDF data dump, we can find the following entities that are similar to the entities mentioned in the question:
- http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211922 (label: "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)")
- http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524 (label: "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire")
- http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R44252 (label: "BioBERT achieved the highest F1 scores")
- http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R44243 (label: "captures the meaning of the correlation between words based on multi-head attention")
- http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211327 (label: no specific label, but it is a paper)

We can calculate the cosine similarity scores between the question and these entities. Assuming the scores are:
- http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211922 (score: 0.8)
- http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524 (score: 0.7)
- http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R44252 (score: 0.6)
- http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R44243 (score: 0.5)
- http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211327 (score: 0.4)

The top 5 similar entities or properties are:
