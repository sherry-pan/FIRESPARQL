Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Indicate the model that performed best in terms of BLEU score metric on the WMT2016 English-German benchmark dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The key entities here are "model" and "WMT2016 English-German benchmark dataset". The property mentioned is "BLEU score metric".

Looking through the context, I see that there are two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a method involving steps for named entity recognition, which doesn't seem directly related to BLEU scores or the WMT dataset. R284316, on the other hand, is a journal article about extracting entity knowledge using models like Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight, but it doesn't mention BLEU scores or the specific dataset in question.

Since the context doesn't provide specific information about models evaluated on the WMT2016 dataset with BLEU scores, I can't retrieve any relevant candidates from the given data. Therefore, the candidates for both "model" and "WMT2016 English-German benchmark dataset" will be empty.
