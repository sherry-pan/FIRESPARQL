Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the WMT2014 English-German dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WMT2014 English-German")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?model        orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?model_lbl)
LIMIT 5;
```    Note: The `str(?dataset_lbl)` function is used to check if the label of the dataset is equal to "WMT2014 English-German". This is because the dataset labels are not always exactly equal to the dataset URIs. The `str()` function is used to convert the label to a string so that the comparison can be performed correctly. 

The SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG RDF data dump. It first filters the datasets to only include the ones with the label "WMT2014 English-German". Then, it queries the benchmarking efforts for each of these datasets, and for each of these efforts, it queries the models. Finally, it orders the results by the model labels in descending order and limits the output to the top 5 models. 

This query is designed to answer the original question, "What are the models that have been benchmarked on the WMT2014 English-German dataset?" by returning the URIs and labels of the models that have been benchmarked on this dataset. 

Note that the query uses the `orkgp:HAS_DATASET` and `orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK` properties to navigate the RDF graph and retrieve the relevant data. The `orkgc:Dataset` and `orkgp:Model` classes are used to specify the types of the dataset and model resources, respectively. The `rdfs:label` property is used to retrieve the labels of the dataset and model resources. 

The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include the models that have been benchmarked on the WMT2014 English-German dataset. The `str()` function is used to convert the dataset label to a string so that the comparison can be performed correctly. 

The `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses are used to order the results by the model labels in descending order and limit the output to the top 5 models, respectively. 

This query is designed to be executed on the ORKG RDF data dump to retrieve the relevant data for the original question.
