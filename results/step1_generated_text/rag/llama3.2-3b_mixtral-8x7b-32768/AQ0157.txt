Question:
What models are being evaluated on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

    SELECT?model?dataset
    WHERE {
   ?dataset orkgc:Resource orkgp:HAS_DATASET?model.
   ?dataset orkgc:Dataset orkgp:HAS_DATASET?model.
   ?dataset orkgc:Dataset orkgp:HAS_DATASET?model.
    Filter(strlike(?dataset, "Penn Treebank (Character Level)")).
    Filter(strlike(?model, "models")).
    }
    ```sparql

    Note: The above SPARQL query is just a sample, and it might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG data. 

    The query aims to find the resources or datasets that are being evaluated on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset, and the models that are being evaluated on this dataset. 

    The `Filter` function is used to filter the results based on the strings "Penn Treebank (Character Level)" and "models". 

    The `strlike` function is used to match the strings, which allows for some flexibility in the matching process. 

    However, the actual implementation may vary based on the actual structure of the ORKG data.
