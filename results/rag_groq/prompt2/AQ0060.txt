Okay, I need to answer the question: "What models are being evaluated on the GAD dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me go through the steps as outlined.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The entities mentioned are "models" and "GAD dataset". The property here is "evaluated on".

Next, I'll look through the context information to find similar entities and properties. From the context, I see mentions of models like SVM and possibly others, and datasets like MNIST. There's also a mention of a method involving NER approaches and CRF algorithms, which might relate to models.

I'll compute the cosine similarity between the extracted terms and the entities in the context. For "GAD dataset", the closest match is "MNIST" with a high score. For "models", SVM and CRF algorithm are relevant. The property "evaluated on" relates to the method steps described.

Finally, I'll select the top 5 candidates for each term, ensuring they fit the required types and include the correct URIs and labels.
