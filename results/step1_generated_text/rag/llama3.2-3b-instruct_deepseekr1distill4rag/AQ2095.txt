Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the Fine-Grained Gating model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?p?o
WHERE {
 ?p a ora:link.
 ?o ora:hasCode?code.
 ?code ora:hasPaper?paper.
 ?paper ora:hasModel?model.
 ?model ora:isFineGrainedGatingModel?model.
 ?paper ora:hasLink?link.
 ?link ora:hasURI?uri.
  FILTER (STR(?uri) = "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075" || STR(?uri) = "10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075")
}
``` 
    Note: The above SPARQL query is based on the provided context and the generated JSON output. It assumes that the RDF data is structured in a specific way, with certain properties and classes defined as shown. The actual RDF data may vary, and the query may need to be adjusted accordingly. 

    Also, note that the Fine-Grained Gating model is not explicitly mentioned in the RDF data, so the query uses the `ora:isFineGrainedGatingModel` property to filter the results. This property is not defined in the provided context, so it is assumed to be a custom property defined in the RDF data. 

    The query also filters the results to only include papers that have a link with the specified DOI. This is based on the assumption that the RDF data contains a `ora:hasLink` property with a `ora:hasURI` property that contains the DOI. 

    Finally, the query only returns the `p` and `o` variables, which correspond to the `ora:link` property and its object, respectively. This is based on the assumption that the RDF data contains a `ora:link` property with a specific URI. 

    The actual query may need to be adjusted to match the actual RDF data and its structure. 

    Also, the output SPARQL query is based on the assumption that the RDF data contains a specific structure and properties, if the actual RDF data has different structure and properties, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly. 

    Please note that this is a generated query based on the provided context and the generated JSON output, and it may not be the optimal or correct query for the actual RDF data.
