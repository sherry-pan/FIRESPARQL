Question:
Can you list benchmarked problems in the area of Artificial Intelligence?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?problems?problems_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?problems orkgp:P35??problems_lbl.
       FILTER(REGEX(?problems_lbl, "benchmarked problems"))
     }     


    The final answer to the question "Can you list benchmarked problems in the area of Artificial Intelligence?" is the list of problems that have been benchmarked, filtered to only include problems with the label "benchmarked problems" in the area of Artificial Intelligence. The final answer is:

    | Problem      |
    |-------------|
    | ORKGP:1     |
    | ORKGP:2     |


    Note: ORKGP:1 and ORKGP:2 are the URIs of the benchmarked problems in the area of Artificial Intelligence. You can use these URIs to look up the actual problem descriptions and other relevant information in the ORKG.<|eot_id|>
