Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the Multimodal PISA dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The question is asking about models and a specific dataset. The key entities here are "models" and "Multimodal PISA dataset". The property that connects them is "evaluated on".

Now, I need to look through the provided context to find information related to these terms. The context has two main sections, each with triples about different resources.

Looking at the first section, I see that R147652 has several steps described, which seem to be part of a method or process. It mentions things like SVM and MNIST as seed terms, and talks about expanding these using SciBERT and k-means. Then it goes on to annotate entities, apply a NER approach with CRF, and filter candidates. This seems more about a method rather than specific models or datasets.

The second section is about R284316, which is a journal article titled "validation research" and is of type "technique". The abstract discusses extracting entity knowledge using NLP tools and a model called jpark. It mentions using tools like Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL. The datasets used for evaluation are AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP. The authors are from Italy, and it was published in 2021.

So, from this, I can gather that the models mentioned are jpark, Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL. The datasets evaluated on are AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP. However, the question is about the Multimodal PISA dataset, which isn't mentioned here.

Wait, that's a problem. The context doesn't mention the Multimodal PISA dataset at all. So, how can I answer the question based on the provided data? It seems like there's no information about models evaluated on that specific dataset.

But maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again. The first resource, R147652, talks about SVM and MNIST, which are a model and a dataset, respectively. The second resource, R284316, talks about models like jpark, Stanford NER, etc., and datasets like AIDA. There's no mention of Multimodal PISA.

So, based on the context, there are no models evaluated on the Multimodal PISA dataset. Therefore, the candidates for "Multimodal PISA dataset" would have a score of 0 because it's not present. For "models", the candidates would be the ones mentioned, but since they aren't evaluated on Multimodal PISA, their scores would be low.

Wait, but the user expects a JSON output with candidates. Since the dataset isn't in the context, maybe the candidates for the dataset would be empty or have zero scores. For models, perhaps the ones mentioned in the context could be listed, but their relevance to the dataset is zero.

Alternatively, maybe I should structure the answer to reflect that there are no relevant models because the dataset isn't present. But the example provided in the query expects some candidates even if they aren't exact matches, based on similarity.

Hmm, perhaps I should include the models from the context as candidates for "models" with their scores, and for the dataset, since it's not present, maybe include the mentioned datasets with lower scores.

Wait, but the question is specifically about models evaluated on Multimodal PISA. Since that dataset isn't in the context, the models can't be linked to it. So, perhaps the candidates for the dataset would be the ones mentioned, but with low similarity scores, and the models would be the ones from the context with their own scores.

I think I need to structure the JSON accordingly, showing that the dataset isn't found but listing the models from the context as candidates for "models" and the datasets as candidates for "Multimodal PISA dataset" with lower scores.

So, putting it all together, the extracted terms would be "models", "evaluated on", and "Multimodal PISA dataset". The candidates for "models" would include jpark, Stanford NER, etc., and for the dataset, the mentioned datasets with lower scores.

I think that's the approach. Now, I'll structure the JSON accordingly, making sure to use the correct prefixes and types.
