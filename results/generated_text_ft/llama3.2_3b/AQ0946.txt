Question:
List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Atari 2600 Fishing Derby benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
     SELECT?metric 
     WHERE {
       ?metric a orkg:EvaluationMetric.
       ?metric rdfs:label?metricLabel.
       ?metric rdfs:comment?metricComment.
       ?dataset a orkg:Dataset.
       ?dataset rdfs:label?datasetLabel.

       ?metricLabel str(?benchmarkLabel).
       ?metricComment str(?benchmarkComment).
    } 
    (Please note that the SPARQL query may not be optimal or even possible to be run on all possible inputs, 
    as the complexity of the query is hard to predict.)
