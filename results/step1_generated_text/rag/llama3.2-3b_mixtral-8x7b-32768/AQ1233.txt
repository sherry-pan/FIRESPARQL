Question:
What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the Walker, walk (DMControl500k) dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?metric?value
WHERE {
 ?dataset a orkg:Dataset.
 ?dataset orkg:hasBenchmarkResult?result.
 ?result orkg:hasMetric?metric.
 ?result orkg:hasValue?value.
 ?dataset orkg:hasDatasetName "DMControl500k".
 ?metric rdfs:label?metricLabel.
 ?value rdfs:label?valueLabel.
  FILTER (STR(?metricLabel) = "highest benchmark result" AND STR(?valueLabel) = "value" )
}
```

    Note: The output SPARQL query is based on the provided context and may not be the only possible SPARQL query that can be generated for the given input question. There could be other possible SPARQL queries that can be generated based on different interpretations of the input question. 

    Note: The actual SPARQL query that would be generated would depend on the actual structure and content of the ORKG, which is not provided in the question.
