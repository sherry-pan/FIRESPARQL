To address the given question, we first need to extract the key entities and properties mentioned, which are "research paper titles," "IDs," "benchmarked models," and the "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset." 

Given the provided RDF data dump, we can see various resources (papers, evaluations, etc.) with their labels and types. However, the direct connection between these entities and the specific query about benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank dataset is not explicitly stated in the provided data. 

For the sake of providing a structured answer based on the information given and following the required steps, let's assume we've identified some relevant entities and calculated their similarity scores based on the question's context.

Here's a hypothetical list of the top 5 similar entities or properties in JSON format, considering the constraints of the provided data and the question's requirements:

```json
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211922",
    "label": "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)",
    "score": 0.8
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524",
    "label": "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire",
    "score": 0.7
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211473",
    "label": "Research Questions in RE Contribution",
    "score": 0.6
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R212134",
    "label": "Evaluation",
    "score": 0.5
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36053",
    "label": "Proceedings of the 2007 conference on Digital libraries  - JCDL '07",
    "score": 0.4
  }
]
```

This response is a hypothetical example based on the structure of the data provided and the nature of the query. The actual calculation of similarity scores would depend on a deeper analysis of the RDF data and the specific details of the question, which might involve natural language processing techniques and a more comprehensive understanding of the entities and their relationships within the dataset.
