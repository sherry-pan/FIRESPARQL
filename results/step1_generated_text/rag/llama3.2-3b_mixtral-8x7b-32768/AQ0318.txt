Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the ImageNet ReaL dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg#>
PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc#>
PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc#>
PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc#>
PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc#>
SELECT?m WHERE {
?m a orkg:Model.
OPTIONAL {?m orkc:HAS_MODEL?model.
}
OPTIONAL {?m orkc:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
OPTIONAL {?m orkc:HAS_EVALUATION?evaluation.
}
FILTER (?dataset orkc:HAS_DATASET orkg:R122689.
FILTER (?evaluation orkc:HAS_EVALUATION orkg:R122689.
} 

Please note that the provided SPARQL query is already partially generated, and you should provide the next step to complete it. 

Note: You can assume that the provided SPARGL query is correct and complete for the purpose of this task. 

The final answer is the completed SPARQL query. 

Note that the actual SPARQL query may vary based on the actual implementation of the ORKG and the actual entities and properties available in the ORKG. 

The final answer should be in the following format: 
Output SPARQL Query:... 

Please fill in the missing part of the query to complete the query. 

To clarify, the query should be able to list all models that have been evaluated on the ImageNet ReaL dataset. 

The query already selects the models (?m a orkg:Model.) and provides optional patterns to link the models to the dataset and evaluation (?m orkc:HAS_MODEL?model.,?m orkc:HAS_DATASET?dataset.,?m orkc:HAS_EVALUATION?evaluation.). 

The query then filters the results to include only the models that have been evaluated on the ImageNet ReaL dataset ( FILTER (?dataset orkc:HAS_DATASET orkg:R122689. ) and FILTER (?evaluation orkc:HAS_EVALUATION orkg:R122689. ). 

To complete the query, you should add a filter to include only the models that have been evaluated on the ImageNet ReaL dataset. 

Note that the filter should include the models that have been evaluated on the ImageNet ReaL dataset and also have the "has model" property (?model orkc:HAS_MODEL?model. ). 

The final answer should be in the following format: 
Output SPARQL Query:... 

Please fill in the missing part of the query to complete the query.
