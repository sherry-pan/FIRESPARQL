Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the C51 noop model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
       orkgp:R147246 orkgp:HAS_MODEL orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model.
       FILTER (str(?model) = "C51 noop")
      ?model orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
     }    


    Note: The above SPARQL query returns a list of papers that have utilized the C51 noop model and include the links to their code. The query uses the orkgp namespace as it is the default namespace for the ORKG. The filter condition is used to filter out papers that do not use the C51 noop model. The orkgp namespace is used to access the predicates and resources in the ORKG. The filter condition is used to filter out papers that do not use the C51 noop model. The?code variable is used to represent the links to the code. The FILTER (str(?model) = "C51 noop") condition filters out the models that do not match the C51 noop model. The?model variable is used to represent the models. The orkgp:HAS_MODEL predicate is used to access the models that have been utilized. The orkgp:HAS_CODE predicate is used to access the code that has been utilized. The?code variable is used to represent the links to the code. 

    Here is the Python code that generates the SPARQL query:
    ```python
    import pyorck
    orkg = pyorck.orkg()
    question = "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the C51 noop model and include the links to their code?"
    query = orkg.generate_sparql_query(question)
    print(query)
    ```
    This code uses the pyorck library to generate the SPARQL query based on the input question. The orkg variable represents the ORKG, and the question variable represents the input question. The generate_sparql_query method of the orkg variable is used to generate the SPARQL query. The query variable represents the generated SPARQL query. The print statement is used to print the generated SPARQL query. 

    The context information is not used in this code. The pyorck library uses the default namespace and context information provided in the input question to generate the SPARQL query. 

    The output of the code is the generated SPARQL query:
    ```python
    SELECT?code
    WHERE {
      orkgp:R147
