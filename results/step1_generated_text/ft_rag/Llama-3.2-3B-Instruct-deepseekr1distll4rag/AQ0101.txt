Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the HMDB51 benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?model
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "HMDB51")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                  orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?eval,
                orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?contribution  orkgp:P31               ?paper;
                rdfs:label              ?cont_lbl.
 ?model        orkgp:P31               ?contribution.
}
```



    Note: The provided RDF data dump and the context information were not included in the problem statement. You should have access to them when running the SPARQL query. The SPARQL query is generated based on the provided input question and context. 

    Please let me know if you need any further assistance. 

    Here is the solution:
    SELECT DISTINCT?model
    WHERE {
     ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
      FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "HMDB51")
     ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
     ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?eval,
                    orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
     ?contribution  orkgp:P31               ?paper;
                    rdfs:label              ?cont_lbl.
     ?model        orkgp:P31               ?contribution.
    }
    Note: The query is not optimized and it's possible that it can be further optimized. Also, the query is based on the assumption that the dataset name is a label and not a separate property. If that's not the case, you might need to adjust the query accordingly.

     ?model        orkgp:P31               ?contribution.
      FILTER (str(?cont_lbl) = "model")
    }
