Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the CL-Titles-Parser model and include the links to their code?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "papers" and "CL-Titles-Parser model." The action is "utilized," which implies a relationship between the papers and the model. Also, the question mentions including links to their code, so I should look for properties related to URLs or code repositories.

Looking at the context information, I see several resources. For example, R147652 describes a method with several steps, and R284316 and R284317 describe papers with their venues, years, authors, and URLs. The URLs are under the predicate "url" and "P26."

Now, I need to compute the similarity between the extracted terms and the entities in the RDF data. The term "CL-Titles-Parser model" isn't explicitly mentioned in the context, so I'll look for similar models or related terms. Since the context includes models like SVM and techniques like NER, I might consider these as related, but they aren't directly the CL-Titles-Parser. However, R284317 has a URL which could be a code link, so that's a point of interest.

Next, I'll select the top candidates. Since "CL-Titles-Parser" isn't present, I'll look for papers that have URLs, assuming they might link to code. R284317 has a URL, so that's a good candidate. Similarly, R147246 has authors but no URL, so it's less relevant for code links.

I'll structure the JSON output as specified, grouping the results by the extracted terms. Each candidate should include URI, label, score, type, and RDF type. Since the model isn't found, I'll note that and include the relevant papers with URLs.

I need to ensure that the URIs use the correct prefixes: "orkgr:" for resources, "orkgp:" for properties, etc. Also, each entry should have "rdfs:label" and the appropriate "rdf:type."

Finally, I'll compile the JSON, making sure it's correctly formatted and includes all necessary fields. Since the model isn't present, the candidates will focus on papers with code links, even if they aren't directly using CL-Titles-Parser.
