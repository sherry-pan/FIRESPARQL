Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The query is asking to list the code links in papers that use the Multi-Perspective Matching (ensemble) model in any benchmark. 

First, I'll break down the query to extract the relevant terms. The key entities here are "Multi-Perspective Matching (ensemble) model" and "code links." The property mentioned is "use" as in papers that use the model. 

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a method involving steps like using seed terms, expanding with SciBERT, and applying a CRF algorithm. R147246 and R283710 mention various authors and publication details. 

I need to find entities related to the model and code links. The model "Multi-Perspective Matching (ensemble)" isn't directly mentioned, but I can look for similar models or methods. The context includes terms like "SVM" and "MNIST," which are related to models and datasets. 

For code links, I'm looking for predicates that indicate where code is stored or linked. The context doesn't explicitly mention code links, but properties like P27 (authors) or P31 (types) might be relevant. 

I'll extract the terms "Multi-Perspective Matching (ensemble) model," "code links," and "use." Then, I'll search the context for similar entities. Since the exact model isn't present, I'll consider related models like "SVM" and "CRF algorithm." 

For code links, I'll look for any properties that might link to external resources, but since none are present, I'll note that. 

Finally, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and the closest matching candidates from the context. Since the exact model isn't found, I'll include related models and note the absence of code links.
