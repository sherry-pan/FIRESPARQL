Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user's question is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the Adaptive Input Large model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "papers" and "Adaptive Input Large model." The property mentioned is "utilized," which relates papers to the model they use. There's also a mention of "links to their code," but looking at the context, I don't see any information about code links, so I might have to ignore that part or note that it's not available.

Next, I need to find similar entities or properties in the provided RDF data. I'll go through each part of the context to see if there are any mentions of the Adaptive Input Large model or related papers. 

Looking at the context, I see several resources like R147652, which describes a method involving steps for named entity recognition. There are also resources like R147244, R147246, and R283709, which seem to be papers or publications with various authors and years. For example, R147246 has authors like Ligia Sierra and others, published in 2015. R283709 is a journal article from 2021 with authors Yuanyuan Wu, Mengxing Huang, Zhaocheng Tu, and Siling Feng. 

I don't see any direct mention of the Adaptive Input Large model in the context. However, R283709 is categorized under "method," "solution proposal," and "entity extraction," which might be related to NLP models. It also has keywords like "Named entity recognition" and "Natural language processing," which are relevant. 

Since there's no exact match for the Adaptive Input Large model, I'll consider papers that are related to NLP tasks, as they might be using similar models or techniques. R283709 seems like a good candidate because it's about entity extraction and uses keyphrase extraction and NER models, which aligns with the context provided.

I also notice that R147652 describes a method involving NER approaches, which could be related, but it doesn't mention specific models like Adaptive Input Large. 

So, I'll focus on R283709 as the primary candidate. I'll structure the JSON output to include this resource under "papers" and "Adaptive Input Large model." Since there's no direct link to code, I'll omit that part.

Finally, I'll make sure the JSON follows the required format with the correct prefixes and types. Each entry will have a URI, label, and type. I'll also include the extracted terms and map the candidates accordingly.
