Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Yelp Fine-grained classification dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The main entities here are "evaluation metrics" and "Yelp Fine-grained classification dataset." The property implied is "benchmarking models on," which relates models to the dataset using some metrics.

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a method with five steps, and R283709 and R283710 are about papers with various properties. However, I don't see any direct mention of evaluation metrics or the Yelp dataset.

Since the Yelp dataset isn't present, I'll look for related concepts. The context mentions "benchmark," "evaluation," and "models." So, I can infer that "benchmarking" relates to evaluation. 

I'll extract terms like "evaluation metrics," "benchmarking," and "Yelp Fine-grained classification dataset." Next, I'll search the RDF data for similar entities and properties. 

I find that R283709 has a predicate P97003 as "entity extraction," which might relate to evaluation. R147652's steps involve NER and CRF algorithms, which could tie into evaluation metrics. 

I'll list the candidates, ensuring they use the correct prefixes. Since the exact dataset isn't there, I'll include related resources and predicates that might be relevant, even if they're not a perfect match.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including the relevant URIs with their types.
