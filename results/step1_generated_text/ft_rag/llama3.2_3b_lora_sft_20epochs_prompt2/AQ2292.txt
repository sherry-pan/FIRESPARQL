Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the C51 noop model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P31 [
         rdfs:label?title
       ];
        orkgp:P32 [
          orkgp:P37587?implementation
        ];
        orkgp:P37588?eval
        FILTER(REGEX(STR(?eval), "C51 noop"))
        orkgp:P37587?implementation
        FILTER(REGEX(STR(?implementation), "C51 noop"))
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(COUNT(?code))
     LIMIT 10<|eot_id|>
