Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given context. The query is asking for a list of papers that used the XLNet (base) model and include links to their code. 

First, I should look through the provided ORKG RDF data to find any mentions of papers. From the context, I see several resources labeled as "Paper". For example, R211524 is a paper titled "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire". Similarly, R211922 is "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)", and R211327 is another paper, but its title isn't specified in the context.

Next, I need to check if any of these papers mention the use of XLNet. However, looking through the context, I don't see any direct references to XLNet. The papers seem to focus on other topics like named entity recognition and neural modeling. 

Since there's no explicit mention of XLNet, I can't confirm which papers used it. Therefore, I can't provide a list based on the given data. The answer should reflect that no relevant information was found in the context provided.

The provided context does not contain any information about papers that utilized the XLNet (base) model or include links to their code. Therefore, no relevant results can be retrieved from the given data.
