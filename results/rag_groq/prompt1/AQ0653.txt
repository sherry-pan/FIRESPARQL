Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given context. The query is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the SciCite dataset, along with their titles and IDs. 

First, I should look through the provided context to find any mentions of research papers. From the context, I see several resources labeled as "Paper". For example, R211524 is a paper titled "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire". Another one is R211922, titled "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)". There's also R211327, which is a paper but the title isn't specified in the context. 

Next, I need to check if any of these papers mention the SciCite dataset. However, looking through the context, I don't see any direct references to "SciCite". The papers mentioned are about named entity recognition and neural modeling, which might be related to NLP tasks, but without explicit mention of SciCite, it's hard to confirm.

Since the context doesn't provide information about the SciCite dataset, I can't accurately determine which papers have benchmarks on it. Therefore, I can't retrieve any relevant papers from the given data. The answer should reflect that no relevant entities were found based on the provided context.

The given context does not contain any information related to the SciCite dataset or research papers that have performed benchmarks on it. Therefore, no relevant entities or properties can be retrieved for this query.
