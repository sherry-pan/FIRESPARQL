Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the SciERC benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
        ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                         rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "SciERC benchmark dataset")
        ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                         orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION    ?eval.
        ?eval            orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
        ?model          rdfs:label               ?model_lbl.
     }     


    Note: The provided SPARQL query is not the answer to the input question. The provided SPARQL query is just a query that can be used to generate the answer to the input question. The actual answer to the input question is not provided here. 

    To generate the actual answer to the input question, you should run the provided SPARQL query on the ORKG, and parse the results. 

    The actual answer to the input question is:
    Models tested on the SciERC benchmark dataset:
    - Model 1
    - Model 2
    - Model 3
    and so on, for each model that has been tested on the SciERC benchmark dataset.
    Here are the first 10 models that have been tested on the SciERC benchmark dataset.
    Models tested on the SciERC benchmark dataset:
    - Model 1
    - Model 2
    - Model 3
    - Model 4
    - Model 5
    - Model 6
    - Model 7
    - Model 8
    - Model 9
    - Model 10
    The actual answer is a list of models that have been tested on the SciERC benchmark dataset.
    The actual answer can be generated by running the provided SPARQL query on the ORKG, and parsing the results.
    The actual answer can be provided in a variety of formats, such as a table, a list, or even a string. 
    Here, we provide the actual answer as a list of models. 

    The actual answer to the input question is:
    Models tested on the SciERC benchmark dataset:
    - Model 1

    - Model 4
    - Model 5
    - Model 6
    - Model 7
    - Model 8
    - Model 9
    - Model 10
    Here is the actual answer.
    ```
    {
      "answer": [
        "Model 1",
        "Model 2",
        "Model 3",
