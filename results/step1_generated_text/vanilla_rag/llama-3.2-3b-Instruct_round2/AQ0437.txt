Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the STL-10 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset?dataset.
     FILTER (bc:datasetName = "STL-10").
    ?paper orkg:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
    ?evaluation orkg:hasMethod?method.
    ?paper orkg:hasApproach?approach.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Name?title.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Number?id
     }<|eot_id|>
