Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Tokenlearner model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
     PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org property/>
     PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>

     SELECT?paper?paperCode?url
     WHERE {
       ?paper wdt:P281?model.
       ?paper wdt:P126?code.
       ?paper wdt:P31 wd:Q1543151.
       ?paper wdt:P577?paperCode.
       ?paper wdt:P179?url.
        FILTER (STR(?paperCode) =~ "Tokenlearner")
        }
     LIMIT 10
     } 
    The final answer is the SPARQL query. I do not have the knowledge graph data. I am only required to generate the SPARQL query. 
    I will use the patterns I learned from the training data to generate the query. 

    I will use the following patterns from my training data:
    - A paper is represented by a Wikidata entity (wd:Q...)
    - A paper has a code associated with it (wdt:P126)
    - A paper has a model associated with it (wdt:P281)
    - A paper has a title associated with it (wdt:P31)
    - A paper has a code associated with it (wdt:P577)
    - A paper has a URL associated with it (wdt:P179)
    - The Tokenlearner model is represented by a Wikidata entity (wd:Q1543151)
    - The Tokenlearner model has a description associated with it (wdt:P577)
    - The Tokenlearner model has a URL associated with it (wdt:P179)
    - The Tokenlearner model's description contains the word "Tokenlearner"

    Based on these patterns, I will generate the SPARQL query. 

    I will use the following steps:
    1. Start with the basic query structure: 
    SELECT?paper?paperCode?url
    WHERE {
       ...
    }
    2. Use the patterns to fill in the blank spaces in the query structure:
    SELECT?paper?paperCode?url
    WHERE {
       ?paper wdt:P281?model.
       ?paper wdt:P126?code.
       ?paper wdt:P31?title.
       ?paper wdt:P577?paperCode.
       ?paper wdt:P179?url.
       ...
    }
    3. Add the filter to ensure that the paper uses the Tokenlearner model:
    SELECT?paper?paperCode?url
    WHERE {
       ?paper wdt:P281?model.
       ?paper wdt:P126?code.
       ?paper wdt:P31?title.
       ?paper wdt:P577?paperCode.
       ?paper wdt:P179?url.
        FILTER (STR(?paperCode) =~ "Tokenlearner")
    }
    4. Add the limit to limit the number of results to 10:
    SELECT?paper?paperCode?url
    WHERE {
       ?paper wdt:P281?model.
       ?paper wdt:P126?code.
       ?paper wdt:P31?title.
       ?paper wdt:P577?paperCode.
       ?paper wdt:P179?url.
        FILTER (STR(?paperCode) =~ "Tokenlearner")
    }
    LIMIT 10
    }
    5. Add the prefix definitions to the query:
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org property/>
    PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>

    The final SPARQL query is:
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org property/>
    PREFIX wd: <http://www.wikidata.org/entity/>

    SELECT?paper?paperCode?url
    WHERE {
       ?paper wdt:P281?model.
       ?paper wdt:P126?code.
       ?paper wdt:P31?title.
       ?paper wdt:P577?paperCode.
       ?paper wdt:P179?url.
        FILTER (STR(?paperCode) =~ "Tokenlearner")
    }
    LIMIT 10
    }
    I have generated the SPARQL query based
