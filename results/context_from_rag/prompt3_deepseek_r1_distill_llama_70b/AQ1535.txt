Okay, so I need to figure out which model has the highest Test perplexity score on the WikiText-2 benchmark. Let me start by breaking down the question. The key terms here are "model," "Test perplexity score," and "WikiText-2 benchmark." 

First, I should look for any mentions of the WikiText-2 benchmark in the provided context. Scanning through the data, I see that there's a resource R147244 with a HAS_VALUE of "93.9." That seems like a high score, but I'm not sure what it's for. Maybe it's related to perplexity?

Next, I need to find models associated with this benchmark. The context mentions several resources like R147246, which has multiple authors, but I'm not sure if that's a model. There's also R283709 and R283710, which are about journal articles and methods, but again, not directly pointing to models.

Looking at the steps described, like using SciBERT and k-means, it seems the context is more about the process than specific models. However, the mention of CRF algorithm in Step 4 might indicate a model type, but I'm not certain.

Since the context doesn't explicitly list models evaluated on WikiText-2, I might have to infer based on the available data. The highest value I see is 93.9, which could be the perplexity score. If that's the case, the model associated with R147244 might be the one with the highest score.

I'm not entirely sure, but based on the given data, I'll go with R147244 as the model with the highest Test perplexity on WikiText-2.
