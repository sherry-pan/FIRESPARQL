Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the 6-layer QRNN model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
        ?paper orkgp:P31?contrib.
        ?contrib orkgp:P32?code.
        ?paper orkgp:P50356?eval.
         FILTER(REGEX(?eval, "6-layer QRNN"))
     }<|eot_id|>
