Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the AAPD dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?paper?title?id WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
    ?dataset orkg:HAS_DATASET <http://example.org/AAPD>.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Titles?title.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_ID?id.
     }<|eot_id|>
