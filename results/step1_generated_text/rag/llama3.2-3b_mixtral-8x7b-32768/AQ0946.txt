Question:
List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Atari 2600 Fishing Derby benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/gr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/predicate/>

SELECT?metric
WHERE {
 ?dataset a orkgr:Dataset.
 ?dataset orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset2.
 ?dataset2 a orkgr:Resource.
 ?dataset2 rdfs:label "Atari 2600 Fishing Derby".
 ?dataset2 orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
 ?metric rdfs:label?metric.
 ?dataset a orkgr:Dataset.
 ?dataset orkgp:EVALUATED_ON?model.
 ?model a orkgr:Model.
 ?model orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
 ?metric rdfs:label?metric.
}
```
