Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What is the name of the top performing model in terms of ROUGE-2 score when benchmarked on the CL-SciSumm dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "model" and "CL-SciSumm dataset", and the property is "ROUGE-2 score". 

Looking at the context, I see that there are two main resources, R147652 and R284316, which describe steps and a research paper respectively. R147652 talks about a method involving SVM and MNIST, which might be a model and dataset. R284316 discusses a journal article about extracting entity knowledge using techniques like jpark, which involves models like Stanford NER and Flair NER.

I need to find models and datasets mentioned. From R147652, the seed terms include "SVM" and "MNIST". From R284316, models like Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL are mentioned. The datasets mentioned are AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP, but not CL-SciSumm.

Since CL-SciSumm isn't in the data, I'll look for similar datasets. The closest is AIDA, which is a benchmark dataset. For models, SVM, Stanford NER, Flair NER, etc., are present.

Next, I'll compute similarity. "CL-SciSumm" isn't present, so I'll consider AIDA as the closest dataset. For models, SVM and the NER models are top candidates. ROUGE-2 isn't explicitly mentioned, but since the context discusses evaluation, I'll map it to a relevant property like "validation research".

Putting it all together, the top candidates for the dataset would be AIDA, and for models, SVM and the NER models. The property would relate to validation or performance.
