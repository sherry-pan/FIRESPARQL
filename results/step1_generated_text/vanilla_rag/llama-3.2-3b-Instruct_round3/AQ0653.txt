Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the SciCite dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:has_benchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:has_dataset "SciCite".
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Titles?title.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Number?id.
     }<|eot_id|>
