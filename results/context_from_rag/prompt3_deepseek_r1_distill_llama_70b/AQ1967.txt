Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the query using the provided context. The query is asking for a list of papers that used the Flair-TDM model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities are "papers" and "Flair-TDM model". The property mentioned is "utilized" or "include links to their code".

Looking at the context, I see that there are two main resources: R147246 and R283710. Both are papers with authors and publication details. R147246 is from 2015 and R283710 is from 2021. 

I need to find if any of these papers used the Flair-TDM model. The context doesn't explicitly mention Flair-TDM, but R283710 is about keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition, which might relate to models like Flair-TDM. 

Since the context doesn't have direct mentions, I'll infer based on the topics. R283710 discusses methods like keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition, which are similar to what Flair-TDM might be used for. 

I'll list R283710 as a candidate since it's more recent and relevant to the model's possible application. R147246 is less likely but included as a possible related paper.

For the properties, I'll include "utilized" and "include links to their code" as the relevant predicates, even though the context doesn't have explicit links, just the structure.
