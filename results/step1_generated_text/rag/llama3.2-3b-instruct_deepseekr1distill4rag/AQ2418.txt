Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the ResNet-152 (SAM) model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/gc/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/gr/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/gr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/p/>

SELECT?paper?code
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgr:has_url?url.
 ?paper orkgr:has_code?code.
 ?paper orkgr:has_subject?subject.
 ?subject orkgc:has_type "Benchmarking Paper".
 ?subject orkgr:has_subject?model.
 ?model orkgr:has_label "ResNet-152 (SAM) model".
}
``` 
    Note: The SPARQL query is based on the provided context and the output of the given JSON data. The query is designed to retrieve papers that benchmark the ResNet-152 (SAM) model and extract the code used in those papers. 

    This query uses the following prefixes:
    - orkg: for the Open Research Knowledge Graph ontology
    - orkgc: for the Generalized Conceptual Graph ontology
    - orkgr: for the Generalized Resource Graph ontology
    - orkgr: for the Generalized Resource Graph ontology (same as orkgr)
    - orkgp: for the Generalized Property Graph ontology
    - orkgp: for the Generalized Property Graph ontology (same as orkgp)

    The query selects two variables:?paper and?code. It then filters papers that have a URL, code, subject, and type "Benchmarking Paper". The subject of the paper should have the model "ResNet-152 (SAM) model" as its subject. 

    Please note that this query is based on the provided context and the output of the given JSON data. It may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Also, please note that this query will only return papers that have a URL and code, and that have a subject with the model "ResNet-152 (SAM) model". If there are other papers that meet the criteria but do not have a URL or code, they will not be returned by this query. 

    This query will return multiple results, one for each paper that meets the criteria. Each result will contain the URI of the paper and the code used in that paper. 

    This query can be executed on the ORKG RDF data dump to retrieve the desired information.
