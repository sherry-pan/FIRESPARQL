Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the WSC dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
```sql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.com/orkg/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://example.com/orkp/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.com/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.com/orkgp/>

SELECT?title?id 
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgr:includes orkgp:INCLUDES?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgr:includes?WSC_dataset.
 ?paper orkgr:has_benchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgr:includes?WSC_dataset.

Note: The prefix declarations are not included in the output SPARQL query. You are expected to provide the correct prefix declarations based on the provided context. 
Also, please note that the prefix declarations are already provided in the context as examples. However, you may need to adjust the prefix declarations based on the actual structure of the ORKG.
Note that the SPARQL query provided is a possible answer based on the context. There may be other possible SPARQL queries that can achieve the same result. 

Please provide the correct prefix declarations and the SPARQL query. 

Here is a sample code that uses the provided context to generate the SPARQL query:

```python
import re

# Define the context
context = {
    "question": "What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the WSC dataset?",
    "extracted_terms": {
        "titles": ["titles"],
        "IDs": ["IDs
