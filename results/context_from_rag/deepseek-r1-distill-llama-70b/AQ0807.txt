Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the Story Cloze Test benchmark dataset. The question is about listing the metrics used, so I should focus on properties related to evaluation, metrics, and benchmarks.

First, I'll look through the JSON properties. I see "evaluation" with the label "evaluation" and "has benchmark" with the label "has benchmark". These seem directly related because benchmarks often involve specific metrics for evaluation.

Next, there are properties like "Accuracy", "Recall", "macro-F1", and "micro-F1". These are common evaluation metrics in machine learning, so they're likely used in model evaluation on benchmarks.

I also notice "NDCG@10", which stands for Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 10. This is a ranking metric, which could be relevant if the Story Cloze Test involves ranking tasks.

Other properties like "has dataset" and "implementation" might be less directly related but could still be useful in understanding how the dataset is used or how models are implemented for the benchmark.

I should list all these properties, explaining why each is relevant. For example, "evaluation" is a general term that covers the process, while specific metrics like "Accuracy" and "F1" provide concrete measurements.

I need to make sure each entry includes the property IRI, label, and a brief reason why it's relevant. This way, the answer is clear and directly tied to the question about metrics for the Story Cloze Test.
