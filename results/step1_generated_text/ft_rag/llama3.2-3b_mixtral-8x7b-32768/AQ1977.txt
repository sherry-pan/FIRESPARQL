Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the STREET model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
       orkgp:R1 orkgp:P7?code.
       orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_PAPER?paper.
      ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
      ?code rdfs:label?code_lbl.
       FILTER(REGEX(?code_lbl, "STREET model"))
      ?paper orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
      ?benchmark rdfs:label?benchmark_lbl.
       FILTER(REGEX(?benchmark_lbl, "benchmarking purposes"))
      ?code rdfs:label?code_lbl.
       FILTER(REGEX(?code_lbl, "code references"))
     }
     Note: The provided SPARQL query contains four filters. The first filter only selects papers that use the STREET model for benchmarking purposes. The second filter only selects papers that use the STREET model. The third filter only selects papers that use the STREET model for benchmarking purposes. The fourth filter only selects papers that use the STREET model for benchmarking purposes. 
    The last two filters are the same, so you can remove the last one.
