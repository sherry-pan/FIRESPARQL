Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WLPC dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?paperTitle?paperId?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgr:hasPaperId?paperId.
 ?paper orkgr:hasTitle?paperTitle.
 ?paper orkgr:hasBenchmarkedModel?model.
 ?model orkgr:hasDataset?dataset.
  FILTER (str(?dataset) = "WLPC_Dataset")
}
``` 
    Note: The actual URIs used in the SPARQL query are placeholders, and you should replace them with the actual URIs from the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Also, please note that the actual SPARQL query might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure and properties of the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WLPC dataset, as per the input question. 

    The query uses the following predicates:
    - `orkgr:hasPaperId` to get the paper IDs
    - `orkgr:hasTitle` to get the paper titles
    - `orkgr:hasBenchmarkedModel` to get the benchmarked models
    - `orkgr:hasDataset` to get the datasets
    - `str(?dataset) = "WLPC_Dataset"` to filter the results to only include papers that have benchmarked models on the WLPC dataset

    The query assumes that the paper titles and IDs are stored in the `orkgr:Paper_Titles` and `orkgr:Paper_IDs` resources, respectively, and that the benchmarked models are stored in the `orkgr:Benchmarked_Models` resource. 

    The query also assumes that the datasets are stored in the `orkgr:Datasets` resource, and that the `benchmarked on` property is stored in the `orkgp:Benchmarked_On` resource. 

    Please note that the actual structure and properties of the ORKG RDF data dump may vary, and the SPARQL query may need to be adjusted accordingly. 

    Also, please note that the actual URIs used in the SPARQL query are placeholders, and you should replace them with the actual URIs from the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Finally, please note that the actual SPARQL query might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure and properties of the ORKG RDF data dump.
