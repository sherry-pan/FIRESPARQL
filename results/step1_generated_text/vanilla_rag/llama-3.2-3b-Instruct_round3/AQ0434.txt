Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Stanford Cars dataset?

 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset "http://orkg.org/orkg/dataset/Stanford Cars".
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Titles?title.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Name?id.
     }<|eot_id|>
