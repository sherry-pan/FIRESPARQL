Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the Walker, walk (DMControl500k) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
PREFIX orkw: <http://example.org/orkw/>

SELECT?title?id 
WHERE {
 ?paper orkp:has_benchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkc:has_dataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkw:includes "Walker, walk (DMControl500k)".
 ?paper orkp:has_id?id.
 ?paper orkp:has_title?title.
}
```



## Step 1: Determine the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
The entities mentioned in the question are "research papers", "benchmark", and "Walker, walk (DMControl500k) dataset". The properties mentioned are "titles" and "IDs".

## Step 2: Identify the corresponding entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
From the provided context, we can see that the following entities and properties are mentioned:
- Entities: "research papers", "benchmark", "Walker, walk (DMControl500k) dataset"
- Properties: "titles", "IDs"
- Candidates:
  - "titles": orkg:R122689, orkg:R131168
  - "IDs": orkg:R122689, orkg:R131168
  - "research papers": orkp:HAS_PAPER
  - "benchmark": orgp:HAS_BENCHMARK
  - "Walker, walk (DMControl500k) dataset": orkg:R122689, orkg:R131168

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query based on the identified entities and properties.
The query should filter research papers that include a benchmark for the Walker, walk (DMControl500k) dataset. It should retrieve the titles and IDs of these papers.

## Step 4: Write the SPARQL query.
```sparql
PREFIX orkg:
