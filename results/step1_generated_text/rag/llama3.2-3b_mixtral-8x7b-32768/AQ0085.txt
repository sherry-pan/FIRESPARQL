Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the WMT2016 English-German dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr#>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc#>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp#>
SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?modelModel.
 ?modelModel orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgc:Dataset?datasetLabel.
 ?datasetLabel orkgr:label "WMT2016 English-German"@en.
 ?model orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?evaluation.
 ?evaluation orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
}
```sparql
    Note: The actual ORKG URIs and labels used in the query may differ from the provided information in the context. The query is generated based on the provided context information. 

    The query first selects models that have a model model (line 1-2) and then filters those models that have been evaluated on the WMT2016 English-German dataset (lines 3-4). The models that have been evaluated on the dataset are then filtered further based on the label "WMT2016 English-German" in English (lines 5-6). The final result will be the models that have been evaluated on the dataset. 

    This query is based on the assumption that the dataset has a label "WMT2016 English-German" and the evaluation has a dataset that is the same as the dataset the models are evaluated on. 

    The query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG. 

    The query is also based on the assumption that the evaluation has a model that is the same as the model that is evaluated.
