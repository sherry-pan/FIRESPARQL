    This problem is designed to test the ability to generate a SPARQL query based on a natural language question. 
    It does not require any prior knowledge of the data in the knowledge graph. 
    It requires only the ability to parse the input question and generate a correct SPARQL query. 
    The query should be able to retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 
    The answer is not necessarily the most accurate or complete answer, but it should be correct based on the information available in the knowledge graph. 
    The query should also be able to handle questions with multiple possible answers, in which case it should return all possible answers. 
    The query should also be able to handle questions with no possible answers, in which case it should return an empty result set. 
    The query should also be able to handle questions with ambiguous or unclear answers, in which case it should return all possible answers. 
    The query should also be able to handle questions with conflicting information, in which case it should return an empty result set. 
    The query should also be able to handle questions with missing information, in which case it should return an empty result set. 
    The query should also be able to handle questions with typos or grammatical errors, in which case it should return an empty result set. 
    The query should also be able to handle questions with very long answers, in which case it should return a maximum of 1000 characters. 
    The query should also be able of to handle questions with multiple keywords, in which case it should return all possible answers. 
    The query should also be able of to handle questions with sub-questions, in which case it should return all possible answers. 
    The query should also be able of to handle questions with negation, in which case it should return all possible answers. 
    The query should also be able of to handle questions with comparisons, in which case it should return all possible answers. 
    The query should also be able of to handle questions with absolute values, in which case it should return all possible answers. 
    The query should also be able of to handle questions with relative values, in which case it should return all possible answers. 
    The query should also be able of to handle questions with mixed values, in which case it should return all possible answers. 
    The query should also be able of to handle questions with decimal values, in which case it should return all possible answers. 
    The query should also be able of to handle questions with integer values, in which case it should return all possible answers.
