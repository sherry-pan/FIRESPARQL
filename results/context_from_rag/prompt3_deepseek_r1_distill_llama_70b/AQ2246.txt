Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The query is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the SAC model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "papers" and "SAC model". The property mentioned is "utilized", which relates papers to the model. 

Looking at the context data, I see several resources related to papers, such as R147246 and R283710, which have authors and publication details. However, I don't see any direct mention of the SAC model. The context includes information about models like SVM and methods like NER, but SAC isn't explicitly listed.

Since the SAC model isn't present in the context, I can't retrieve specific papers that used it. But I can still provide a structure that the user can use to query the ORKG system. I'll outline the JSON format, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including placeholders for URIs and types.

I'll make sure to use the correct RDF prefixes for URIs and include the necessary types. Even though there are no direct matches, structuring the answer this way will help the user understand how to approach similar queries with different data.
