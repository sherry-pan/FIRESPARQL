Question:
What is the most common Knowledge representation method?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?method
WHERE {
 ?paper     a            orkgc:Paper;
            rdfs:label   ?paper_label.
  FILTER (str(?paper_label) = "Knowledge representation method")
 ?contrib      orkgp:P30     ?paper;
                orkgp:P31     ?method.
}
ORDER BY (ASC(?score))
LIMIT 5
```    end of codeblock     . 

Note: The `?score` variable is not present in the provided context. It's assumed that the similarity scores are calculated and available in the data. The actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual data structure and the scoring mechanism used.<|eot_id|>
