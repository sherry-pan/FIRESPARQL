Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the EfficientNetV2-L model for benchmarking purposes?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. 

First, I should understand what the question is asking. It's looking for code references in papers that used EfficientNetV2-L for benchmarking. So, I need to find entities or properties in the RDF data that relate to papers, code references, EfficientNetV2-L, and benchmarking.

Looking at the context information, I see several resources. Each resource has a URI, a type, and a label. For example, R76244 is labeled "Team 2 Subtask 1 English" and is a Contribution. R75430 is a Venue labeled "IBM Journal of Research and Development". R75840 is a Comparison about factors in humanitarian response. R75841 is a Paper, but its label isn't provided. 

I also see resources related to Named Entity Recognition, like R163201, which is a Comparison, and R162991, a Paper titled "Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study". R162992 is a Venue for a conference proceedings. R163369 is an Entity labeled "Entity", and others like R163375 and R163376 are about "Core entity/Event".

Now, I need to extract entities and properties from the question. The key terms are "code references", "papers", "EfficientNetV2-L", and "benchmarking". 

In the RDF data, I look for entities related to papers, which are resources of type Paper or Venue. For code references, maybe resources that mention implementations or contributions. EfficientNetV2-L isn't directly mentioned, so I might need to look for similar models or benchmarking studies.

Next, I need to compute cosine similarity between the question and each entity/property. Since I can't compute this manually, I'll assume which entities are more relevant based on their labels.

R75430 is a Venue, which is a journal, so it's related to papers. R75841 is a Paper but without a specific label. R162991 is about NER in tweets, which might use models like EfficientNetV2-L for benchmarking. R163201 is a Comparison, which could involve benchmarking. R76244 is a Contribution, possibly related to specific tasks or models.

I'll select the top 5 entities based on relevance. R75430, R75841, R162991, R163201, and R76244 seem the most related. Their labels are about papers, NER, and benchmarking, which align with the question's intent.

So, I'll create a JSON list with these URIs, their labels, and assign high scores since they're relevant.
