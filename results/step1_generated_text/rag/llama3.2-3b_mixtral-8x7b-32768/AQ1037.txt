Question:
Can you provide the highest benchmark result, including the metric and score, for the Scholarly entity usage detection dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT?metric?score WHERE {
   ?dataset a orkggc:Dataset.
   ?dataset orkggp:HAS_DATASET?dataset2.
   ?dataset2 orkggp:HAS_BEST_RESULT?result.
   ?result orkggp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
   ?result orkggp:HAS_SCORE?score.
    FILTER (?dataset = orkggr:R122689)
}
```

    The provided SPARQL query retrieves the highest benchmark result, including the metric and score, for the Scholarly entity usage detection dataset. It queries the ORKG to find the dataset with the highest benchmark result, and then retrieves the metric and score from this result. The filter clause ensures that only the dataset with the URI `orkgr:R122689` is considered.<|eot_id|>
