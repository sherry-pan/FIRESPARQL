Question:
What is the top benchmark score and its metric on the Hutter Prize dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?score?metric 
     WHERE {
    ?score orc:relatedTo?metric.
    ?metric orc:relatedTo?score.
    ?score orc:relatedTo?dataset.
    ?dataset orc:relatedTo?score.
    ?score orc:hasMetric?metric.
    ?metric orc:hasMetric?score.
    ?score orc:hasDataset?dataset.
    ?dataset orc:hasDataset?score.
     FILTER (STR(?score) = "93.9" )
     }
    END;
