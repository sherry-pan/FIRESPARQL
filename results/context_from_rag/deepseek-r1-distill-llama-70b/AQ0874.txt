Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the NCBI Disease benchmark dataset. The question is about listing the metrics used, so I should focus on properties related to evaluation, metrics, and performance.

Looking through the JSON, I see properties like "evaluation" with label "evaluation". That seems directly related because evaluation metrics are what's used to assess model performance.

Next, there's "Accuracy" which is a common metric. It measures how accurate the model's predictions are, so that's definitely relevant.

"Recall" is another important metric. It tells us how well the model detects all instances of a disease, so it's a key performance indicator.

"macro-F1" and "micro-F1" are F1 scores, which combine precision and recall. They're essential for evaluating classification tasks, especially when dealing with multiple classes or imbalanced datasets.

"has benchmark" might be useful because it indicates that the dataset has established benchmarks, which include specific metrics used for evaluation.

"method" could be relevant if it refers to the evaluation methods or approaches used, but it's a bit more general. However, in the context of evaluation, it might still be applicable.

"number of type" could relate to the number of disease types or classes, which affects the evaluation metrics used, especially in multi-class scenarios.

"has dataset" is more about the existence of the dataset, but since the question is about the NCBI Disease dataset, it might not be directly about the metrics but could be useful for context.

"evaluation" is already listed, but it's crucial because it directly relates to the process of assessing model performance.

"has classes" indicates the number of classes or categories in the dataset, which is important for understanding which metrics are appropriate (like macro vs. micro averages).

"Accuracy" is already mentioned, but it's worth emphasizing as a primary metric.

"Recall" is also already noted, but it's a fundamental metric in this context.

"macro-F1" and "micro-F1" are both important, so they should be included.

"has benchmark" is about the presence of benchmarks, which tie into the evaluation metrics.

"method" could refer to the evaluation methods used, so it's relevant.

"number of type" helps in understanding the dataset's structure, which influences the choice of metrics.

"has dataset" is more about the dataset's existence but still part of the evaluation context.

"evaluation" is central to the question, so it's included again.

"has classes" is about the dataset's structure, affecting the evaluation approach.

"Accuracy" is a key metric, so it's included again.

"Recall" is another key metric, so it's listed again.

"macro-F1" and "micro-F1" are both essential for classification tasks.

"has benchmark" indicates the use of standard metrics for evaluation.

"method" could refer to the evaluation techniques used.

"number of type" relates to the dataset's categories, influencing the metrics.

"has dataset" is about the dataset itself, which is the focus of the question.

"evaluation" is central, so it's included again.

"has classes" is about the dataset structure, affecting evaluation.

"Accuracy" is a primary metric.

"Recall" is another primary metric.
