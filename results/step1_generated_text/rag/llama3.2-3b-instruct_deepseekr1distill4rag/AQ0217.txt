Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 English-to-German benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    
    SELECT?model?label 
    WHERE {
     ?model orkgc:hasModel?m.
     ?m orkgp:hasEvaluationMethod?e.
     ?e orkgp:hasDataset?d.
      FILTER (str(?d) = "Reuters RCV1/RCV2 English-to-German benchmark dataset")
      BIND (str(?m) AS?label)
    }
    ``` 
    Note: The SPARQL query is based on the provided context and question. The actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG. 

    This query retrieves the models that have been tested on the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 English-to-German benchmark dataset. It does this by first selecting models that have a model (m) and then selecting the evaluation method (e) of that model. Then, it filters the evaluation methods to only include those that have the specified dataset (d). Finally, it binds the label of the model (m) to the?label variable. 

    The query uses the predicates orkgc:hasModel, orkgp:hasEvaluationMethod, and orkgp:hasDataset to link the models to their respective evaluation methods and datasets. The filter statement is used to only include models that have been tested on the specified dataset. 

    The query also uses the BIND function to convert the string representation of the model to its label. 

    The actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG. 

    This query is based on the assumption that the ORKG has the following structure:

    - Models are represented as resources with a label (rdfs:label) and a type (rdfs:type).
    - Evaluation methods are represented as resources with a label (rdfs:label) and a type (rdfs:type).
    - Datasets are represented as resources with a label (rdfs:label) and a type (rdfs:type).
    - The orkgc:hasModel, orkgp:hasEvaluationMethod, and orkgp:hasDataset predicates are used to link models to their respective evaluation methods and datasets.

    This query is based on the context provided, which includes the following information:

    - The models Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, End-to-End Neural EL, and CRF are mentioned in the context.
    - The evaluation methods Evaluation Method and Performance Assessment are mentioned in the context.
    - The dataset Reuters RCV1/RCV2 English-to-German benchmark dataset is mentioned in the context.

    This query retrieves the models that have been tested on the specified dataset, along with their labels.
