Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WLPC dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://orkgr.org/resource/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://orkgc.org/resource/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkgp.org/resource/>
    SELECT?paperTitle?paperID?benchmarkedModel
    WHERE {
   ?paper?hasTitle?paperTitle.
   ?paper?hasID?paperID.
   ?paper?hasDataset?dataset.
   ?dataset orkgr:R122689.
   ?paper?hasModel?benchmarkedModel.
   ?benchmarkedModel?hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    FILTER (lang(?benchmark) = 'en').
    }
    ```sparql

## Step 1: Determine the relevant entities and properties from the context.
From the context, the relevant entities and properties are:
- Research paper titles and IDs: orkgr:R122689, orkgp:HAS_TITLE, orkgp:HAS_ID
- Benchmarked models: orkgp:HAS_MODEL, orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK
- WLPC dataset: orkgr:R122689, orkgp:HAS_DATASET

## Step 2: Construct the SPARQL query based on the relevant entities and properties.
The SPARQL query should retrieve research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WLPC dataset. It should use the following predicates:
- orkgp:HAS_TITLE to get the research paper title
- orkgp:HAS_ID to get the research paper ID
- orkgr:R122689 to link to the WLPC dataset
- orkgp:HAS_MODEL to get the benchmarked models
- orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK to get the benchmark

## Step 3: Write the SPARQL query.
```sparql
SELECT?paperTitle?paperID?benchmarkedModel
WHERE {
 ?paper?hasTitle
