Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the W-14 dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data. Let me start by understanding the process step by step.

First, I should extract the relevant terms from the question. The question is asking about models and their evaluation on a specific dataset. The key entities here are "models" and "W-14 dataset". The property involved is "evaluated on".

Looking at the context data, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there are resources like R147656, R147657, etc., and predicates like P39020 which describe steps. But I'm not sure if these are directly related to models or datasets.

I need to find entities and properties that match "models" and "W-14 dataset". In the context, I see mentions of "METHOD" and "DATASET" instances as seed terms, like "SVM and MNIST". This suggests that "models" might be related to METHOD instances, and datasets to DATASET instances.

The question is about models evaluated on the W-14 dataset. So I should look for resources that are datasets named "W-14" and models that have been evaluated on them. In the context, I don't see "W-14" explicitly mentioned, but maybe it's referred to by another name or code.

Wait, looking through the context, I see resources like R147244 which has a value of "93.9", but that's probably a metric, not a dataset. Then there are resources like R147246 which is linked to authors and a venue, but that's about a publication, not a dataset.

In the second part of the context, there's a description of an analysis involving 32,090 funded projects and mentions of keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition. There's a resource R283709 which is a journal article with various predicates like "method", "solution proposal", etc. It also mentions "Named entity recognition" and "Natural language processing".

But I'm not seeing any direct mention of "W-14" or models evaluated on it. Maybe I need to infer based on the structure. Since the context includes steps for NER approaches, perhaps the models used in those steps are the ones evaluated on certain datasets.

In the first part, Step 4 mentions using a CRF algorithm, which is a type of model. So maybe the models are the ones used in the NER approach. The datasets mentioned are seed terms like MNIST, but not W-14.

Since the context doesn't explicitly mention "W-14 dataset", I might have to consider that the data provided doesn't include that specific dataset. Therefore, I might not find any direct matches. However, I can structure the answer based on the available data.

So, the extracted terms would be "models" and "W-14 dataset", with the property "evaluated on". The candidates would be the resources that are models, even if they aren't specifically linked to W-14 in the context.

Looking at the context, the models mentioned are SVM and possibly others from the steps. So, I can list those as candidates, even if the dataset isn't explicitly mentioned.

I need to structure the JSON output with the question, extracted terms, and candidates. Each term should have its top matches, using the correct URIs and types.

I think that's how I should approach it, even if the exact dataset isn't present in the context.
