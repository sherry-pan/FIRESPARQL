Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to answering the question: "Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the Multimodal PISA dataset?" 

First, I'll break down the question. It's asking about models evaluated on a specific dataset, so I'm looking for properties related to evaluations, models, datasets, and possibly the results or metrics used.

Looking at the JSON properties, I see several that might be useful. 

1. "hasEvaluation" (P71075) seems directly relevant because it's about evaluations, which is what the question is asking about.
2. "evaluation" (HAS_EVALUATION) is another property that clearly relates to evaluations, so it's a good fit.
3. "method" (HAS_METHOD) is important because models are often referred to as methods in this context, and the question is about models.
4. "has dataset" (HAS_DATASET) is relevant because the question specifies the Multimodal PISA dataset, so this property would link the evaluation to the correct dataset.

I don't see any properties that directly mention models, but "method" is a common substitute in research contexts. There's also "implementation" which could relate to how models are applied, but it's a bit more specific than needed here.

So, the most relevant properties are the ones related to evaluations, methods (as models), and datasets. These will help connect the models to their evaluations on the specified dataset.

The most relevant properties from the JSON file that could help answer the question about models evaluated on the Multimodal PISA dataset are:

1. **hasEvaluation (P71075)**: This property is directly related to evaluations, which is central to the question.
2. **evaluation (HAS_EVALUATION)**: Clearly pertains to the evaluation process of models.
3. **method (HAS_METHOD)**: Refers to the methods or models used, which is what the question is asking about.
4. **has dataset (HAS_DATASET)**: Links the evaluation to the specific dataset mentioned, ensuring relevance to the Multimodal PISA dataset.

These properties together provide the necessary information to identify and connect the models with their evaluations on the specified dataset.
