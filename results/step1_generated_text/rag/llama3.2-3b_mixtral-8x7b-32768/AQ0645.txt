Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the HoC dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg#>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc#>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp#>

    SELECT?title?id WHERE {
   ?paper orkggp:hasPaper?rpaper.
   ?rpaper orkgp:hasDataset?dataset.
   ?dataset orkgp:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
   ?benchmark orkgp:hasTitle?title.
   ?benchmark orkgp:hasID?id.
    Filter (?dataset orkggc:Dataset == "HoC" ).
    }
    ``` 

The final answer is: 
```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg#>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc#>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp#>

SELECT?title?id WHERE {
   ?paper orkgp:hasPaper?rpaper.
   ?rpaper orkgp:hasDataset?dataset.
   ?dataset orkgp:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
   ?benchmark orkgp:hasTitle?title.
   ?benchmark orkgp:hasID?id.
    Filter (?dataset orkggc:Dataset == "HoC" ).
}
```

Please note that the actual answer might be different because the actual query was not provided in the prompt. This answer is just an example. 

If you have any further questions or need help with anything else, feel free to ask! 

Let me know if you would like me to explain any part of the solution. 

The provided context seems to suggest that the query is related to research papers, the HoC dataset, and their relationships. The query seems to be correctly linking the entities and properties from the context to the SPARQL query.
