What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the WNLI dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?metric?value
WHERE {
 ?benchmark orkgp:P31?eval.
 ?eval orkgp:P33?metric;
         orkgp:P34?value.
  FILTER(REGEX(?value, "Accuracy"))
}
ORDER BY DESC(?value)
LIMIT 5
```<|eot_id|>
