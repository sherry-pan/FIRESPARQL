    LIMIT 10
    Note: There are 5 benchmarks with the same top metric and value for CommonsenseQA. Only the top 10 results are returned. 
    To avoid ambiguity, the query uses the following assumptions:
    1) The dataset with the highest top benchmark value is the answer.
    2) If there are multiple benchmarks with the same top value, the one with the highest metric is the answer.
    3) The query only returns the top 10 results.
