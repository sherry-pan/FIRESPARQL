Question:
What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset SQuAD2.0?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    SELECT?metric?value
    WHERE {
       ?s orkgr:R122690 orkgp:HAS_DATASET?d.
       ?d orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK_RESULT?r.
       ?r orkgp:HAS_TOP_RESULT?tr.
       ?tr orkgp:HAS_METRIC?m.
       ?m orkgp:HAS_VALUE?v.
        FILTER (?m = "F1"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float>)
        FILTER (?v = "0.99"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#float>)
    }
    ```sparql

## Step 1: Identify the key entities and properties mentioned in the question.
The key entities and properties mentioned in the question are: SQuAD2.0, top benchmark result, metric, and value.

## Step 2: Map the entities and properties from the question to the entities and properties in the ORKG context.
From the ORKG context, we can see that SQuAD2.0 is a dataset, and the top benchmark result, metric, and value are related to benchmarking and evaluation.

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query based on the mapped entities and properties.
We can construct the SPARQL query by following the relationships between the entities and properties in the ORKG context. The query should start by finding a dataset with the URI "orkgr:R122690" that is related to SQuAD2.0, then find the benchmark result for that dataset, and finally find the metric and value of that benchmark result.

## Step 4: Filter the results to get the top benchmark result with the correct metric and value.
We need to filter the results to get the top benchmark result with the correct metric and value. The correct metric and value are F1 and 0.99, respectively.

## Step 5: Write the final SPARQL query.
