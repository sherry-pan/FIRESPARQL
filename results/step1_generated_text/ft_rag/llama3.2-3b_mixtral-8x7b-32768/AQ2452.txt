Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the AxCell model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code_ref
     WHERE {
      ?model    orkgc:R123456
       rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.

    This SPARQL query is designed to answer the input question. The query starts by identifying papers that use the AxCell model for benchmarking purposes. It then filters these papers to only include those that have code references. The final result will be a list of code references found in papers that have used the AxCell model for benchmarking purposes. 

    Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the query:

    1. The query starts by identifying papers that use the AxCell model for benchmarking purposes. It does this by first binding the model to the correct value (R123456) and then filtering the results to only include papers that have the AxCell model.
    2. The query then filters these papers to only include those that have code references. This is done using the OPTIONAL and FILTER clauses.
    3. The final result will be a list of code references found in papers that have used the AxCell model for benchmarking purposes.

    The query uses several key predicates and properties from the ORKG, including:
    - orkgc:R123456 (the correct URI for the AxCell model)
    - orkgp:HAS_MODEL (the predicate for the Ax
