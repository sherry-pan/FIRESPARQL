Question:
What is the best performing model benchmarking the CIFAR-10 Image Classification dataset in terms of Percentage error metric?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://orkg.org/collections/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkg.org/predicates/>
SELECT?model?dataset?metric 
WHERE {
 ?dataset orkg:hasModel?model.
 ?dataset a orkgc:Dataset.
 ?dataset orkg:hasMetric?metric.
 ?metric rdfs:label "Percentage Error".
  FILTER (str(?dataset) = "CIFAR-10")
}
```
