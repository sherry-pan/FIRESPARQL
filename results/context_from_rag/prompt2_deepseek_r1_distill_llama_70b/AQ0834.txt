Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Can you list the metrics used to evaluate models on the QNLI dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "metrics" and "QNLI dataset". The action is "evaluate models on". So, I'm looking for metrics used in evaluating models, specifically on the QNLI dataset.

Next, I'll look through the context information to find related entities and properties. From the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a method with steps involving NER and CRF algorithms. R284316 talks about a research article on entity knowledge extraction using models like Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight, and mentions metrics like F1-score and accuracy.

I need to identify which parts of the context relate to evaluation metrics. In R284316, the abstract mentions that they evaluate using different datasets and tools, and they measure performance, which implies metrics like accuracy or F1-score. Also, R147652's steps involve a CRF algorithm, which is often evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.

Now, I'll compute the similarity between the extracted terms and the context. "Metrics" would relate to performance measures like F1-score, accuracy, etc. "QNLI dataset" isn't directly mentioned, but since it's a dataset, I can look for similar datasets in the context, like MNIST or ACL Anthology, but they aren't present. However, the evaluation methods and metrics used in the context can still apply.

I'll select the top candidates. For "metrics", the most relevant are F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall. For "QNLI dataset", since it's not in the context, I'll look for any dataset-related entities, but since none are present, I might have to infer or note that it's not directly mentioned.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON output, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including their URIs, labels, scores, types, and RDF types based on the context.
