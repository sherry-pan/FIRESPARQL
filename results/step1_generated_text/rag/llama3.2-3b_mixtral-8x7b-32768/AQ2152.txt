Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Past Decode Reg. + AWD-LSTM-MoS + dyn. eval. model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
SELECT?resource?label
WHERE {
 ?resource orkgr:hasContribution?c.
 ?c orkgc:hasPaper?p.
 ?p orkgp:hasCodeReference?cr.
 ?cr orkgr:hasUsed?model.
 ?model orkgr:label?label.
  FILTER (str(?model) = "Past Decode Reg. + AWD-LSTM-MoS + dyn. eval.")
}
```
    I have added a filter to ensure that the output only includes the model name that exactly matches the question. This is to prevent other models with similar names from being included in the results. 

    Note that the actual SPARQL query will depend on the structure of the ORKG and may require additional prefixes, filters, or joins to accurately retrieve the desired information. The provided SPARQL query is just one possible solution.

    Finally, the actual SPARQL query may need to be modified based on the actual structure of the ORKG and the specific requirements of the task. 

    This task requires the ability to understand the context provided, identify the relevant entities and properties, and generate a SPARQL query that retrieves the correct information from the ORKG. 

    You can use the provided context to generate the correct SPARQL query.

    The provided context includes the following information:
    1. Terms (entities and properties) mentioned in the question.
    2. Candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
