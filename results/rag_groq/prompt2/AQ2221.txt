Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The user is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the AlexNet and MultiGrasp models, including links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information. The context has two main sections from the ORKG RDF dump. The first part describes a research process with five steps, and the second part talks about a journal article titled "validation research" with some authors and a DOI link.

I notice that the second part of the context mentions a resource R284317, which is a journal article. It has a URL predicate with "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075" and a P26 predicate with the same DOI. The authors listed are Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta, published in 2021, volume 11.

Now, the user is asking about papers using AlexNet and MultiGrasp. However, looking through the context, I don't see any mention of AlexNet or MultiGrasp. The context only discusses models like SVM and techniques related to NER and entity linking, not computer vision models like AlexNet. The paper in the context seems to focus on knowledge graph construction and NLP tasks, not robotics or grasp models.

Since the context doesn't provide any information about AlexNet or MultiGrasp, I can't extract any relevant papers or code links from it. Therefore, the answer based on the given context would be that there are no relevant papers found. 

I should structure the JSON response as per the example, extracting the terms "AlexNet", "MultiGrasp model", and "code links". For each term, I'll list the candidates, but since there's no relevant data, each list will be empty.

```json
{
  "question": "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the AlexNet, MultiGrasp model and include the links to their code?",
  "extracted_terms": [
    {
      "rdfs:label": "AlexNet",
      "uri": "orkgr:AlexNet",
      "type": "Model",
      "rdf:type": "orkgc:Resource"
    },
    {
      "rdfs:label": "MultiGrasp model",
      "uri": "orkgr:MultiGrasp_model",
      "type": "Model",
      "rdf:type": "orkgc:Resource"
    },
    {
      "rdfs:label": "code links",
      "type": "Property",
      "rdf:type": "orkgp:Predicate"
    }
  ],
  "candidates": {
    "AlexNet": [],
    "MultiGrasp model": [],
    "code links": []
  }
}
```
