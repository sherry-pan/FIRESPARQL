Okay, I need to figure out the most relevant properties from the given JSON file that correspond to the question: "What are the metrics of evaluation over the DuIE dataset?" 

First, I should understand what the question is asking. It's about evaluation metrics used on the DuIE dataset. So, I'm looking for properties related to evaluation, metrics, datasets, etc.

Looking at the JSON example provided, I see properties like "evaluation", "has benchmark", "has dataset", "method", etc. These seem relevant because they relate to how evaluations are conducted and what metrics are used.

Now, I'll go through each property in the context information. I see properties like "Recall", "micro-F1", "Accuracy", "macro-F1", "hasEvaluation", and others. These are all metrics or related to evaluation processes.

I should list each relevant property, note its IRI and label, and explain why it's relevant. For example, "Recall" is a common evaluation metric, so it fits. "micro-F1" and "macro-F1" are specific F1 scores used in evaluations. "Accuracy" is another key metric. "hasEvaluation" indicates that evaluation was performed, which is directly related.

I also notice properties like "has dataset" which could link the evaluation to the specific dataset in question, but since the question is about metrics, I might focus more on the metric-related properties.

I should make sure each entry in the answer includes the IRI, label, and a brief reason why it's relevant. I'll avoid mentioning the context directly, as per the instructions.

So, compiling all the relevant properties, I'll structure the answer as a list of objects with the required fields.
