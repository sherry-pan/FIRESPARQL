Question:
What models are being evaluated on the WOS-11967 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model orkgc:subclassOf* orkgc:Model.
 ?model orkgp:evaluatedOn?dataset.
  FILTER (STR(?dataset) = "MNIST_dataset" && STR(?model) IN ("SVM", "CRF", "SciBERT"))
}
``` Sparql Query Explanation:
The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve models that are being evaluated on the MNIST dataset. The query first identifies models that are subclasses of the Model class. Then, it filters the results to only include models that are evaluated on the MNIST dataset. The `STR(?dataset) = "MNIST_dataset"` filter ensures that only the MNIST dataset is considered. The `STR(?model) IN ("SVM", "CRF", "SciBERT")` filter ensures that only the specified models are included in the results. 

Note that the URIs in the query are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual URIs of the models and datasets in the ORKG. 

The SPARQL query uses the `orkgp:evaluatedOn` property to link models to the datasets they are being evaluated on. The `orkgc:subclassOf*` property is used to traverse the hierarchy of classes in the ORKG. 

The `FILTER` clause is used to apply filters to the results. In this case, it filters the results to only include models that are being evaluated on the MNIST dataset and are one of the specified models. 

Note that the `STR(?dataset) = "MNIST_dataset"` filter is used to convert the dataset to a string, as the `STR` function is used to convert the dataset to a string. 

The `STR(?model) IN ("SVM", "CRF", "SciBERT")` filter is used to check if the model is one of the specified models. 

The `IN` operator is used to check if the model is one of the specified models.
