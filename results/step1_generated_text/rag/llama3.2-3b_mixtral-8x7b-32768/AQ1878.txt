Question:
Name the datasets that have been used for benchmarking in the Robot Navigation research problem?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
    PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/ontology/>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://orkp.org/ontology/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkg.org/predicate/>
    SELECT?dataset?benchmark
    WHERE {
       ?dataset orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
        FILTER (rdfs:label(?dataset) = "Robot Navigation").
        FILTER (rdfs:label(?benchmark) = "benchmarking").
    }
    ``` 
    Note: This response was generated based on the provided prompt and the given context. The outputted query is based on the assumptions and interpretations made from the provided context. 

    The final answer is not necessarily a numerical value but rather a generated SPARQL query. 

    The query is designed to query the ORKG for datasets that have been used for benchmarking in the Robot Navigation research problem. The query filters the results to include only those datasets that have been used for benchmarking and have the labels "Robot Navigation" and "benchmarking". 

    Please note that the actual query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure and data in the ORKG. 

    The query uses the provided context to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG. 

    The query is written in SPARQL, a query language for RDF and OWL. 

    The query uses the following prefixes: rdfs, orkg, orkp, and orkgp, which are used to identify the URIs of the RDF schema, ORKG, ORKP, and ORKG predicates, respectively. 

    The query selects the dataset and benchmark UR
