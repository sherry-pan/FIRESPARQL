Answer Key:
The metrics used to evaluate models on the RotoWire (Content Ordering) benchmark dataset are:
1. Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC)
2. Mean Average Precision (MAP)
3. Precision-Recall Curve (PR-Curve)
4. Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (APRC)

Please note that the actual metrics used may vary based on the dataset and the specific task at hand. The above answer is based on general knowledge and may not be specific to the RotoWire (Content Ordering) benchmark dataset.
