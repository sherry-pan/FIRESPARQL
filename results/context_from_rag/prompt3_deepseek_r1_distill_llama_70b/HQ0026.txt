Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question "Which QA benchmarks incorporating more than 10000 questions?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "QA benchmarks" and "10000 questions." The property implied is "incorporating" or maybe "has more than 10000 questions."

Looking at the context, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there's a resource R147652 which has steps related to a method, and another resource R283709 which is a journal article about graph analytics and named entity recognition. There's also R283710, which is another article with authors listed.

I need to find entities that are benchmarks, specifically QA benchmarks, and have a property indicating the number of questions. In the context, I don't see any direct mentions of QA benchmarks or the number of questions. However, there are mentions of datasets like "MNIST" and methods like "SVM," but those are more related to machine learning rather than QA benchmarks.

Wait, maybe I should look for any resources that are datasets or benchmarks. R147652 is about a method, so perhaps it's not a benchmark. R283709 is a journal article, so it's not a benchmark either. R283710 is another article, so again, not a benchmark.

Hmm, perhaps the context doesn't have the specific information needed. But I need to proceed with what's available. Let me check the predicates. There's P39020 which describes steps, P31 which is a type, HAS_VENUE, P29 for year, P28 for volume, P27 for authors, etc. None of these seem to relate to the number of questions in a benchmark.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The question is about QA benchmarks with over 10k questions. The context doesn't have any specific benchmarks with that size. So, perhaps the answer is that there are no matching benchmarks in the provided data.

But the example output provided includes some entries, so maybe I should structure the answer even if there's no match. Alternatively, perhaps I should look for any dataset or benchmark mentioned and include them, even if they don't meet the 10k question criteria.

Looking again, I see R147652 is a resource with steps, but it's not a benchmark. R283709 is a journal article about methods, not a benchmark. R283710 is another article. So, there are no QA benchmarks in the context.

Therefore, the candidates for "QA benchmarks" would be empty. Similarly, for "10000 questions," there's no data. So, the JSON output would have empty arrays for these terms.

Wait, but the example output had some entries. Maybe I should include any related terms, even if they're not exact matches. For instance, R147652 is a method, but maybe it's related to benchmarks. Alternatively, perhaps I should include any dataset or resource as a candidate, even if it's not a QA benchmark.

Alternatively, perhaps the context doesn't have the necessary information, so the candidates would be empty. But the example expects some entries, so maybe I should include the closest matches, even if they're not perfect.

In conclusion, based on the provided context, there are no QA benchmarks with over 10,000 questions mentioned. Therefore, the candidates for "QA benchmarks" and "10000 questions" would be empty. However, to structure the answer properly, I'll include the relevant terms with empty arrays.
