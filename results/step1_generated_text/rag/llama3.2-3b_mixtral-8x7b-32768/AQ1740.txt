Question:
Which model has achieved the highest Permuted Accuracy score on the Sequential MNIST benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?m?s?sc 
     WHERE {
    ?m a ora:Model.
    ?m ora:hasModel?m1.
    ?m1 ora:hasScore?sc.
    ?m1 ora:hasDataset?s.
    ?s a ora:Dataset.
     FILTER (str(?s) = "MNIST").
     FILTER (str(?sc) = "Permuted Accuracy score").
     }
    Note: You may assume that the correct answer is the first match in the results. 

```
SELECT?m?s?sc 
WHERE {
 ?m ora:hasModel?m1.
 ?m1 ora:hasScore?sc.
 ?m1 ora:hasDataset?s.
 ?s ora:Dataset.
  FILTER (str(?s) = "MNIST").
  FILTER (str(?sc) = "Permuted Accuracy score").
}
```

Note: The final answer is the SPARQL query only, not the explanation. 

The final answer is $\boxed{SELECT?m?s?sc 
WHERE {?m ora:hasModel?m1.?m1 ora:hasScore?sc.?m1 ora:hasDataset?s.?s ora:Dataset. FILTER (str(?s) = "MNIST"). FILTER (str(?sc) = "Permuted Accuracy score"). }}$.
