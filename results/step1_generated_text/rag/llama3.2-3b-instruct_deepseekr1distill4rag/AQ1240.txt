Question:
What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset Oxford-IIIT Pets?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?metric?value
WHERE {
 ?result rdfs:label?label.
  FILTER (strcontains(STR(?label), 'validation') && strcontains(STR(?label),'research')).
 ?result rdfs:label?label.
 ?result a?dataset.
  FILTER (strcontains(STR(?dataset), 'Oxford-IIIT_Pets')).
 ?result orkgr:has_value?value.
 ?result orkgr:has_metric?metric.
 ?result orkgr:has_result?result.
 ?metric a orkgp:Metric.
 ?value a orkgc:Value.
 ?dataset a orkgc:Dataset.
  FILTER (MAX(?value) =?value).
}
``` Sparql Query with Binding for Value:
```sparql
SELECT?metric?value
WHERE {
 ?result rdfs:label?label.
  FILTER (strcontains(STR(?label), 'validation') && strcontains(STR(?label),'research')).
 ?result rdfs:label?label.
 ?result a?dataset.
  FILTER (strcontains(STR(?dataset), 'Oxford-IIIT_Pets')).
 ?result orkgr:has_value?value.
 ?result orkgr:has_metric?metric.
 ?result orkgr:has_result?result.
 ?metric a orkgp:Metric.
 ?value a orkgc:Value.
 ?dataset a orkgc:Dataset.
  FILTER (MAX(?value) =?value).
}
``` 
    Note: The `sparql` keyword is used to define the SPARQL query language syntax. The `?` symbol is used to represent a variable, and the `.` symbol is used to represent a property. The `strcontains` function is used to search for a substring within a string. The `MAX` function is used to find the maximum value among the values of a resource. The `FILTER` construct is used to apply a filter to the results. The `a` keyword is used to indicate that a resource is of a certain type. The `or` keyword is used to indicate an "or" condition. The `rdf:type` keyword is used to specify the type of a resource. The `rdfs:label` keyword is used to specify the label of a resource. The `orkgr` and `orkgp` prefixes are used to refer to the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) and its properties, respectively. The `orkgc` prefix is used to refer to the ORKG's entities, such as resources and values. The `orkgp` prefix is used to refer to the ORKG's predicates, such as properties. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset Oxford-IIIT Pets. It uses the `strcontains` function to search for the keywords "validation" and "research" in the labels of resources, and the `strcontains` function to search for the keywords "Oxford-IIIT_Pets" in the labels of resources. It uses the `MAX` function to find the maximum value among the values of a resource. The `FILTER` construct is used to apply filters to the results.
