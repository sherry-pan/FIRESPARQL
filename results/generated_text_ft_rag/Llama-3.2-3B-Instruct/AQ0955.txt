Question:
What are the metrics of evaluation over the Atari 2600 Defender dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?metric,?eval
     WHERE {
         orkgp:R211473 orkgp:rdfs_labels/label?eval.
         FILTER(REGEX(?eval, "evaluation"))
        ?eval orkgp:P31 orkgp:R212134.
        ?eval orkgp:P32?metric.
         FILTER(REGEX(?metric, "metrics"))
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(?eval)
     LIMIT 5
```


    Please note that the output is a SPARQL query that you can execute on an ORKG endpoint to get the desired results. The query is designed to retrieve the top 5 similar entities or properties from the given RDF data based on the provided natural language question. The query first filters the results to include only those related to evaluation and metrics. It then orders the results by the evaluation score in descending order and limits the output to the top 5.<|eot_id|>
