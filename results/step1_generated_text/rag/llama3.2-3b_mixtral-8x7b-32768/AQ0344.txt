Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the SemEval-2018 Task 7 dataset dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?title?id 
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?paperPaper.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_ID?id.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
 ?dataset rdfs:label?title.
 ?dataset orkgr:R122689.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_DATASET?benchmarkDataset.
 ?benchmarkDataset orkgr:R122689.
}
```

    If you need more information about the ORKG, you can ask. 

    The provided context contains the following entities and properties:
    - SemEval-2018 Task 7 dataset dataset (orkgr:R122689)
    - Benchmark (orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK)
    - Titles (orkgp:HAS_TITLE)
    - IDs (orkgp:HAS_ID)
    - Research papers (orkgp:HAS_PAPER)
    - Dataset (orkgp:HAS_DATASET)
    - Paper (orkgp:HAS_PAPER)
    - Benchmark dataset (orkgp:HAS_DATASET)

    The question is: What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the SemEval-2018 Task 7 dataset dataset?
    The goal is to generate a SPARQL query that queries the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question.

    The generated SPARQL query is:
    ```sparql
SELECT?title?id 
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?paperPaper.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_ID?id.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
 ?dataset rdfs:label?title.
 ?dataset orkgr:R122689.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_DATASET?benchmarkDataset.
 ?benchmarkDataset orkgr:R122689.
}
```

    The query first identifies the research papers that have a benchmark for the SemEval-2018 Task 7 dataset dataset by checking if the paper has a benchmark and if the benchmark is associated with the dataset. It then filters the results to only include papers that
