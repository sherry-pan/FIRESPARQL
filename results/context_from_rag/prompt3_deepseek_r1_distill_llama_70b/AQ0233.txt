Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question "What models are being evaluated on the AESLC dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by understanding the question. The user is asking about models that have been evaluated using the AESLC dataset. So, the key terms here are "models" and "AESLC dataset." The action is "evaluated on," which implies a relationship between the models and the dataset.

Looking at the context information, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, there's a resource R147652 which has multiple steps described. Each step is a string with a specific predicate P39020. These steps talk about methods, datasets, and the process of named entity recognition (NER). There's also another resource R147244 with a value of "93.9," which might be an accuracy score or something similar.

Then there's R147246, which seems to be a publication or paper with various authors and the year 2015. The venue is R147247, and it's linked via P31 to R147248. There's also R283709, which is a journal article with various keywords like "Graph analytics," "Horizon 2020," "Keyphrase extraction," etc. It's linked to R283712 via P31 and has a venue R283711. The authors include Yuanyuan Wu, Mengxing Huang, Zhaocheng Tu, and Siling Feng.

Now, the task is to extract relevant terms from the question. The question mentions "models" and "AESLC dataset." The action is "evaluated on," which would translate to a predicate in the RDF data. So, I need to find entities related to "models" and "AESLC dataset" and the predicate that connects them, which is "evaluated on."

Looking through the context, I don't see any direct mention of "AESLC dataset." The datasets mentioned are "MNIST" in the steps, but that's it. However, the process described in the steps involves expanding seed terms, annotating training data, applying NER, and filtering candidates. This suggests that the method involves some form of evaluation, possibly on datasets.

Since the AESLC dataset isn't explicitly mentioned, I might need to infer or find the closest related entities. But in the given context, there's no AESLC dataset, so maybe the answer will have to be based on the available datasets and models.

Wait, but the user provided an example where they had to list models evaluated on the MPQA dataset, and in the expected output, they included URIs for the dataset and the models. So, perhaps in this case, even if AESLC isn't present, I can structure the answer based on the available data.

Looking at the context, the main resources are R147652, R147244, R147246, R283709, and R283710. R147652 has steps that involve models like SVM and datasets like MNIST. R283709 is about a method involving keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition, with authors listed in R283710.

So, perhaps the models mentioned are related to NER, like the CRF algorithm mentioned in Step 4. The datasets used might be MNIST, but since the question is about AESLC, which isn't present, I might have to consider that the context doesn't have the specific dataset.

But wait, the context does mention "MNIST" as a seed term. So, maybe the models evaluated are SVM and others, but the dataset is MNIST. Since AESLC isn't present, perhaps the answer will have to list models evaluated on MNIST or other available datasets.

Alternatively, maybe the context includes other datasets implicitly. For example, R283709 has keywords like "Named entity recognition," which might imply datasets used for NER tasks, but without specific names.

So, to structure the answer, I need to extract the terms "models" and "AESLC dataset" and the predicate "evaluated on." Then, find the top candidates for each.

For "models," the context mentions "SVM" and "NER approach using CRF algorithm." So, the models could be SVM and CRF. For the dataset, since AESLC isn't present, perhaps the closest is MNIST or other datasets mentioned in the steps.

But since the question is about AESLC, and it's not in the context, maybe the answer will have to list the models evaluated on the available datasets, even if they aren't AESLC.

Alternatively, perhaps the context includes other datasets. Let me check again. The initial seed terms include "SVM" and "MNIST." Then, in the steps, they expand these terms. So, the datasets used are MNIST and others expanded from it.

Therefore, the models are SVM and CRF, and the datasets are MNIST and possibly others. Since the question is about AESLC, which isn't present, the answer might not have exact matches, but I can structure it based on the available data.

So, the extracted terms would be "models," "AESLC dataset," and "evaluated on." The candidates for "models" would be SVM and CRF. For "AESLC dataset," since it's not present, perhaps there are no direct candidates, but maybe the dataset is related to NER, so perhaps the MNIST dataset is a candidate, even though it's for a different task.

Alternatively, perhaps the context includes other datasets. Let me check the context again. The main datasets mentioned are MNIST and the ones expanded from the seed terms. So, MNIST is the primary dataset.

Therefore, the models evaluated on MNIST would be SVM and CRF. Since the question is about AESLC, which isn't present, the answer might not have exact matches, but I can structure it based on the available data.

So, the JSON output would have "models" pointing to SVM and CRF, and "AESLC dataset" pointing to MNIST or other datasets, but since AESLC isn't present, maybe it's not included. Alternatively, perhaps the dataset is inferred as part of the evaluation process.

Wait, but in the example provided, the output included URIs for the dataset and models, even if they weren't exact matches. So, perhaps in this case, I can include the available datasets and models, even if they aren't AESLC.

So, putting it all together, the extracted terms are "models," "AESLC dataset," and "evaluated on." The candidates for "models" would be SVM and CRF, and for "AESLC dataset," perhaps MNIST or other datasets, but since AESLC isn't present, maybe it's not included.

Alternatively, perhaps the dataset is part of the evaluation process, so the predicate "evaluated on" would link models to datasets. So, in the context, the models are SVM and CRF, and the dataset is MNIST.

Therefore, the JSON output would list "models" as SVM and CRF, and "AESLC dataset" as MNIST, even though it's not an exact match. Or perhaps, since AESLC isn't present, the dataset candidates are empty.

But the example provided included the dataset even if it wasn't an exact match, so maybe I should include MNIST as a candidate for the dataset.

So, the final JSON would have "models" with SVM and CRF, "AESLC dataset" with MNIST, and "evaluated on" as the predicate linking them.

Wait, but in the example, the output included URIs for the dataset and models. So, I need to map the terms to their URIs in the context.

Looking back, the context has resources like R147652, which is about the method steps. R147244 has a value of 93.9, which might be an accuracy score. R283709 is a journal article about methods including NER.

So, perhaps the models are linked via predicates like P39020, which describes the steps. The dataset MNIST is mentioned in step 1 as a seed term.

Therefore, the URIs for the models could be orkgr:R147652, and the dataset could be orkgr:R122689 (MPQA), but since MPQA is mentioned in the example, not in the current context.

Wait, in the current context, the dataset mentioned is MNIST. So, perhaps the URI for MNIST is orkgr:R122689, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, it might be a different URI.

Alternatively, perhaps the dataset is linked via a predicate like P97003 (entity extraction) or P97004 (solution proposal).

I think I'm getting a bit stuck here because the context doesn't explicitly mention AESLC, so I have to make do with the available data.

In summary, the extracted terms are "models," "AESLC dataset," and "evaluated on." The candidates for "models" are SVM and CRF, for "AESLC dataset" perhaps MNIST, and the predicate is "evaluated on."

So, the JSON output would reflect that, with URIs for the models and dataset as per the context.
