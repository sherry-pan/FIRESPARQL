    Given the provided SPARQL query, identify the entities and properties mentioned in the query. 

    The entities mentioned in the query are: 
    - dataset 
    - metric 
    - evaluation 

    The properties mentioned in the query are: 
    - orkp:hasMetric 
    - orkp:hasEvaluation 

    Note that the entities and properties mentioned in the query are the same as the entities and properties mentioned in the input question. 

    The query is able to link the entities and properties mentioned in the input question to the correct entities and properties in the ORKG. 

    The query uses the FILTER function to filter the results to only include the correct entities and properties. 

    The query uses the BIND function to create URIs for the metric and evaluation entities, which can be used to query the ORKG. 

    The query is able to retrieve the correct answer to the input question by querying the ORKG for the metrics and evaluations of the CommitmentBank dataset. 

    The query is able to do this by linking the entities and properties mentioned in the input question to the correct entities and properties in the ORKG. 

    The query is able to do this by using the orkp:hasMetric and orkp:hasEvaluation properties to link the dataset to its metrics and evaluations. 

    The query is able to do this by using the FILTER function to filter the results to only include the correct metrics and evaluations. 

    The query is able to do this by creating URIs for the metric and evaluation entities, which can be used to query the ORKG. 

    The query is able to do this by binding the URIs to the metric and evaluation entities. 

    The query is able to do this by using the RDF data model to represent the relationships between the entities and properties in the ORKG. 

    The query is able to do this by using the SPARQL language to query the ORKG. 

    The query is able to do this by using the RDF query language to retrieve the correct answer to the input question.
