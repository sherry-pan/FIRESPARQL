Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the BUCC German-to-English dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?title?id WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:includes_benchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:includes_dataset?dataset.
 ?dataset ora:label?datasetLabel.
 ?paper ora:uri?id.
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset ora:label?datasetLabel.
  FILTER (str(?datasetLabel) = "BUCC German-to-English dataset").
}
```
    The SPARQL query retrieves the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the BUCC German-to-English dataset by matching the dataset label and paper URI. The query uses the `ora:ResearchPaper`, `ora:includes_benchmark`, `ora:includes_dataset`, and `ora:Dataset` predicates, as well as the `ora:uri` property to retrieve the paper IDs. The filter clause ensures that only papers with a benchmark for the specified dataset are included in the results.<|eot_id|>
