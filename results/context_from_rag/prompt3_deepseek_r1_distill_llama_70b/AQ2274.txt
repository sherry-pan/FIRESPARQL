Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PEGASUS model for benchmarking purposes?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The key entities and properties mentioned are "PEGASUS model," "benchmarking purposes," and "code references in papers." So, I'll note these as the extracted terms.

Next, I need to find similar entities or properties in the RDF data. Looking through the context, I see mentions of models like "SVM" and datasets like "MNIST." There's also information about papers, such as those related to "Ligia Sierra" and "Betty L LÃ³pez." The RDF data includes properties like P27 for authors, P28 for issue numbers, and P29 for publication years.

I'll start by searching for the "PEGASUS model." In the context, there's a resource R283709 which is a "Journal Article" and involves "method," "solution proposal," and "entity extraction." It also mentions "Graph analytics" and "Named entity recognition," which might be related. Another resource, R147246, is linked to authors and the year 2015, which could be relevant if they used PEGASUS.

For "benchmarking purposes," I look for terms related to evaluation or benchmarks. The context has P5044 as "Journal Article" and P41924 as "scholarly domain." There's also a mention of "HAS_VALUE" with "93.9," which might indicate some benchmarking results.

Regarding "code references in papers," I need to find properties or entities that link papers to their code. The context doesn't explicitly mention code references, but properties like P27 (authors), P31 (type), and HAS_VENUE might help infer where code is mentioned. For example, a paper might have a venue that includes code references.

Now, I'll map these to the appropriate RDF prefixes. "PEGASUS model" would be under "orkgr:" as a specific resource. "Benchmarking purposes" could relate to properties like "orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK" or "orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION." "Code references in papers" might use "orkgp:HAS_CODE_REFERENCE" or similar.

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their top candidates. Each candidate will have a URI, label, and type. I'll make sure to use the correct prefixes and include the necessary types like "orkgc:Resource" or "orkgp:Predicate."

Finally, I'll ensure the JSON is properly formatted, grouping the results by each extracted term and including up to five candidates for each. This will help in generating the appropriate SPARQL queries later on.
