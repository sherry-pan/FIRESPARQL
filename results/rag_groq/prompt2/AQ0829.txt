Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question "What are the metrics of evaluation over the CommitmentBank dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "metrics of evaluation" and "CommitmentBank dataset." "Metrics of evaluation" refers to the properties or predicates used to assess something, probably related to performance or quality. "CommitmentBank dataset" is a specific dataset, so I'm looking for any mentions of it in the context.

Looking at the context, I see several resources. The first part talks about a resource R147652 which has steps involving NER and CRF algorithms. It mentions metrics like F1-score and accuracy with values like 93.9. Then there's R284316, which discusses validation research and techniques, and it's a journal article. It also mentions evaluation using different datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP, but not CommitmentBank specifically.

Wait, the CommitmentBank dataset isn't directly mentioned in the context. Hmm, that's a problem. But maybe there are related metrics or datasets that I can infer. Let me check the predicates and resources again.

In R147652, the steps involve evaluation metrics like F1-score (0.939) and accuracy (93.9). These are common evaluation metrics. Also, R284316 talks about evaluation using different tools and datasets, but again, not CommitmentBank.

Since CommitmentBank isn't present, I might have to consider if there are any other datasets mentioned that could be similar or if the metrics used for other datasets can be applied here. Alternatively, maybe the context doesn't have information on CommitmentBank, so the answer might be limited.

But according to the task, I should extract terms and find similar entities or properties. So, I'll proceed with the terms I have. The extracted terms are "metrics of evaluation" and "CommitmentBank dataset." 

Next, I need to compute similarity. Since CommitmentBank isn't in the context, I'll look for other datasets and their associated metrics. For example, R147652 mentions F1-score and accuracy. R284316 talks about using datasets like AIDA and TAC-KBP with metrics like accuracy and F1.

So, the metrics of evaluation here are F1-score and accuracy. The datasets mentioned are AIDA, MEANTIME, TAC-KBP, but not CommitmentBank. However, since the question is about CommitmentBank, I might have to assume that similar metrics are used, even if the dataset isn't explicitly mentioned.

Putting this together, the extracted terms are "metrics of evaluation" and "CommitmentBank dataset." The candidates for "metrics of evaluation" would be F1-score and accuracy. For "CommitmentBank dataset," since it's not present, maybe there are no direct matches, but perhaps other datasets are close, though not exactly.

Wait, in the context, R147652 has a resource with P39020 which includes steps, and R147244 has a HAS_VALUE of 93.9, which is likely accuracy. So, the metrics are F1-score and accuracy.

Therefore, the JSON output should list these metrics under "metrics of evaluation" and note that CommitmentBank dataset isn't found but perhaps other datasets are mentioned, though not relevant here.

I think that's the best I can do with the given context.
