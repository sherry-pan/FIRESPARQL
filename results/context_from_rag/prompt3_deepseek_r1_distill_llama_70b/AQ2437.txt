Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user's question is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the BiT-S (ResNet) model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "papers" and "BiT-S (ResNet) model". The action is "utilized", which implies a relationship between the papers and the model.

Looking at the context data, I see that there are several resources related to papers, such as R147246 and R283710, which have properties like P27 listing authors and P29 indicating the year. However, I don't see any direct mention of the BiT-S model or ResNet in the context. 

Since the context doesn't provide specific information about the BiT-S model or papers using it, I can't extract any specific entities or properties related to the model. Therefore, the candidates for both "papers" and "BiT-S (ResNet) model" would be empty in this case.

I should structure the JSON output as specified, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including the appropriate URIs and types, even if no matches are found. This way, the output adheres to the format but accurately reflects the lack of relevant data in the context.

```json
{
  "question": "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the BiT-S (ResNet) model and include the links to their code?",
  "extracted_terms": {
    "papers": [],
    "BiT-S (ResNet) model": [],
    "utilized": []
  },
  "candidates": {
    "papers": [],
    "BiT-S (ResNet) model": [],
    "utilized": []
  }
}
```
