Question:
What is the top benchmark score and its metric on the Hendrycks Test dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric?metric_lbl (MAX(?value) AS?score)
     WHERE {
         orkgr:R103931 orkgp:compareContribution?cont.
        ?cont orkgp:P32?eval.
        ?eval rdfs:label?metric_lbl.
        ?cont orkgp:P33?dataset.
        ?dataset rdfs:label?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER(REGEX(STR(?dataset_lbl), "Hendrycks Test"))
        ?cont orkgp:P34?value.
         BIND(XSD:integer(?value) AS?value)
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(?score)
     LIMIT 1
     ```; Joining the datasets for the given query would result in a query with multiple lines of code. To fix this, we can use a single line of code with multiple SELECT statements. Here's an example of how to do this:
     ```sql
     SELECT?metric?metric_lbl (MAX(?value) AS?score) 
     FROM orkgr:R103931, orkgp:compareContribution 
     WHERE {
         orkgr:R103931 orkgp:compareContribution?cont.
        ?cont orkgp:P32?eval.
        ?eval rdfs:label?metric_lbl.
        ?cont orkgp:P33?dataset.
        ?dataset rdfs:label?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER(REGEX(STR(?dataset_lbl), "Hendrycks Test"))
        ?cont orkgp:P34?value.
         BIND(XSD:integer(?value) AS?value)
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(?score)
     LIMIT 1

     ```; Note that the original query already uses a single line of code, so there is no need to make any changes. However, if you wanted to join the datasets for the given query, you could modify the query as shown above. The main difference is that instead of having multiple SELECT statements, we have a single SELECT statement with a comma-separated list of datasets. The FROM clause then specifies the datasets to join. The rest of the query remains the same. Note that the original query already uses a single line of code, so there is no need to make any changes.

The only difference between the two queries is the use of a comma-separated list of datasets in the FROM clause. The original query uses separate SELECT statements for each dataset, while the modified query uses a single SELECT statement with a comma-separated list of datasets.
