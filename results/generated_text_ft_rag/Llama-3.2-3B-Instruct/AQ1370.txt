Question:
What is the top benchmark score and its metric on the Nottingham dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric?metric_lbl (MAX(?value) AS?score)
     WHERE {
        ?dataset       a            orkgc:Dataset;
                        rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Nottingham")
        ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
        ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
        ?eval           orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                        orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.
        ?metric          rdfs:label              ?metric_lbl.
        ?value           orkgp:HAS_VALUE         ?eval;
                         orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.
     } ORDER BY DESC(?score) LIMIT 5.```



Note: The actual output is not a single value, but a list of values. This is because the query is designed to retrieve the top 5 benchmark scores, and each score is associated with a specific metric. The output is a list of these scores, along with their corresponding metrics and labels. 

Also, the query is case-sensitive, and the dataset label "Nottingham" is used to filter the results. If the dataset label is not provided or is different, the query will not return any results. 

The query uses the `MAX` aggregation function to retrieve the maximum value for each metric, and the `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results in descending order based on the score. The `LIMIT` clause is used to retrieve only the top 5 results. 

The query assumes that the `orkgp:HAS_DATASET`, `orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK`, `orkgp:P31`, `orkgp:HAS_METRIC`, `orkgp:HAS_VALUE` and `rdfs:label` properties are present in the RDF data. 

If any of these properties are missing, the query will not return any results. 

The query also assumes that the `orkgp:HAS_VALUE` property has a value that is a literal (e.g. a string or a number). If the value is not a literal, the query may not work as expected. 

Overall, the query is designed to retrieve the top 5 benchmark scores for the Nottingham dataset, along with their corresponding metrics and labels. If the dataset label is not provided or is different, the query will not return any results.<|eot_id|>
