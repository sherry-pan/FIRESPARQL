Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question: "List the code links in papers that use the Duel noop model in any benchmark?" 

First, I'll break down the question. It's asking for code links in papers that use a specific model (Duel noop) in any benchmark. So, I need properties related to code, papers, models, and benchmarks.

Looking at the JSON, I see properties like "has benchmark" which is directly related to benchmarks. That's a good fit. Then, "implementation" might refer to how the model is implemented, which could include code links. 

"Has dataset" could be relevant because datasets are often linked to papers and might include code. "Evaluation" is another relevant term because papers often evaluate models on benchmarks, and evaluations might mention code.

"Method" is also important because the Duel noop is a method or model used in papers. "Approach" could relate to how the model is applied, which might include code references.

So, I'll list these properties with their IRIs and explain why each is relevant. They connect to benchmarks, code implementation, datasets, evaluations, methods, and approaches, all of which are parts of the question.
