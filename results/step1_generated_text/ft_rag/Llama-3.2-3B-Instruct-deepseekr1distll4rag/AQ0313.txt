Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the Classical music, 5 seconds at 12 kHz dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a            orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label   ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Classical music, 5 seconds at 12 kHz")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
      ?paper         orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
       OPTIONAL {?paper      orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
               ?model      rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.}
      ?contrib      orkgp:HAS_PAPER         ?paper.
       OPTIONAL {?contrib      orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
               ?model      rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.}
     } 
     ORDER BY DESC(?model_lbl) 
     LIMIT 5

    The SPARQL query provided is designed to answer the question "Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the Classical music, 5 seconds at 12 kHz dataset?" The query starts by selecting the model and its label, then filters for the specific dataset, and continues to retrieve the relevant information. The query uses the `FILTER` function to check if the dataset label matches the specified string, and the `OPTIONAL` clause to handle cases where the dataset or model may not be present. The results are ordered in descending order by the model label score and limited to the top 5 similar entities.<|eot_id|>
