Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?code
WHERE {
 ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
            rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                  orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
}
```     .count(?code)
```     .order by(?cont rdfs:label?cont_lbl)
```     .limit 10
```      ``` 
    Note: The above SPARQL query is a direct translation of the provided context and question. The query is designed to retrieve the code used in papers that benchmark the BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model. The query first filters the model to ensure it's the BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model, then it retrieves the code for each paper that has a dataset. The code is then filtered to ensure it's the correct code. The results are ordered by relevance and limited to the top 10. 

    This query assumes that the ORKG data dump contains the necessary information to answer the question. The query may need to be modified if the data dump contains different information or if the information is not properly linked. 

    The query also assumes that the code is properly linked to the model and that the model is properly linked to the dataset. If the code is not properly linked to the model or the model is not properly linked to the dataset, the query will not return the correct results. 

    The query uses the following variables:

    -?model_lbl: The label of the model.
    -?model: The model itself.
    -?dataset: The dataset used in the benchmark.
    -?cont: The contribution (paper) that contains the dataset.
    -?cont_lbl: The label of the contribution.
    -?code: The code used in the contribution.

    The query uses the following functions:

    - str(): Converts a value to a string.
    - FILTER(): Filters the results based on a condition.
    - orkgp:HAS_DATASET, orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK, orkgp:HAS_MODEL, orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE: These functions are used to retrieve the dataset, benchmark, model, and code used in the contribution.
    - rdfs:label: Retrieves the label of the model, contribution, and code.
    - count(): Counts the number of results.
    - order by(): Orders the results by relevance.
    - limit: Limits the number of results to the top 10. 

    The query is designed to be executed on the ORKG data dump to retrieve the code used in papers that benchmark the BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model. The query may need to be modified if the data dump contains different information or if the information is not properly linked. 

    The query uses the following predicates:

    - orkgc:HAS_DATASET, orkgp:HAS_DATASET: These predicates are used to retrieve the dataset used in the benchmark.
    - orkgc:HAS_BENCHMARK, orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK: These predicates are used to retrieve the benchmark used in the contribution.
    - orkgc:HAS_MODEL, orkgp:HAS_MODEL: These predicates are used to retrieve the model used in the contribution.
    - orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE: This predicate is used to retrieve the code used in the contribution.
    - rdfs:label: This predicate is used to retrieve the label of the model, contribution, and code. 

    The query is designed to be executed on the ORKG data dump to retrieve the code used in papers that benchmark the BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model. The query may need to be modified if the data dump contains different information or if the information is not properly linked. 

    The query uses the following filters:

    - str(?model_lbl) = "BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo": Filters the results to ensure the model is the BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model.
    - FILTER (?cont rdfs:label?cont_lbl): Filters the results to ensure the contribution is relevant to the model.
    - orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE?code: Retrieves the code used in the contribution.
    - count(?code): Counts the number of results.
    - order by(?cont rdfs:label?cont_lbl): Orders the results by relevance.
    - limit 10: Limits the number of results to the top 10.
