Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Large mLSTM model and include the links to their code?

    Please note that the ORKG model hierarchy is: orkgc:Model orkgp:Dataset orkgp:SourceCode. In the query, we first filter the models to get only the "Large mLSTM" model. Then we find the benchmarks that have the "Large mLSTM" model. For each benchmark, we find the source code. The `?cont` variable is short for "contestant" and it is assumed that there is only one source code for each model. The `?code` variable is the source code. The `str(?model_lbl) = "Large mLSTM"` filter is used to filter the models. The `?cont` variable is assumed to have only one source code. The `?cont` variable is used to find the source code. The `?cont` variable is used to find the source code. The `?cont` variable is used to find the source code. The `?cont` variable is used to find the source code. The `?cont` variable is used to find the source code. The `?cont` variable is used to find the source code. The `?cont` variable is used to find the source code.
