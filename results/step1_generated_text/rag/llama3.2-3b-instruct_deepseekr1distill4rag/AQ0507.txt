Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the TempEval-3 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?paperID 
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:includesBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:dataset?dataset.
 ?dataset ora:datasetName "TempEval-3 Dataset"@en.
 ?paper ora:ID?paperID.
}
``` 
    Note: The `@en` is the language tag for English. You can omit it if you want to query in any other language. 

This query retrieves the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the TempEval-3 dataset. It uses the `ora:ResearchPaper`, `ora:includesBenchmark`, `ora:dataset`, and `ora:datasetName` predicates from the ORKG to query the data. The `ora:datasetName` predicate is used to filter the results to papers that include a benchmark for the TempEval-3 dataset. The `ora:ID` predicate is used to retrieve the IDs of the papers. 

Note that the `ora:` prefix is used to access the properties and classes from the ORKG. You can modify the query to use the `orkgp:` prefix if you want to use the `orkgp:` namespace instead. 

Also, the `?paper` variable is used to represent the research papers, and `?paperID` is used to represent the IDs of the papers. The `?benchmark` variable is used to represent the benchmarks, and `?dataset` is used to represent the datasets. 

You can modify the query to retrieve additional information by adding more variables and predicates. 

Please let me know if you need any further assistance. 

Here's a breakdown of the query:

* `SELECT?paper?paperID`: This line specifies the variables that we want to retrieve. We want to retrieve the titles (`?paper`) and IDs (`?paperID`) of the research papers.
* `WHERE {... }`: This line starts the `WHERE` clause, which defines the conditions under which we want to retrieve the data.
* `?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.`: This line specifies that we want to retrieve research papers that are instances of the `ora:ResearchPaper` class.
* `?paper ora:includesBenchmark?benchmark.`: This line specifies that we want to retrieve research papers that include a benchmark. The `ora:includesBenchmark` predicate is used to link the research papers to the benchmarks.
* `?benchmark ora:dataset?dataset.`: This line specifies that we want to retrieve the datasets that are associated with the benchmarks. The `ora:dataset` predicate is used to link the benchmarks to the datasets.
* `?dataset ora:datasetName "TempEval-3 Dataset"@en.`: This line specifies that we want to retrieve the datasets that have a name that includes the string "TempEval-3 Dataset" in English. The `ora:datasetName` predicate is used to link the datasets to their names.
* `?paper ora:ID?paperID.`: This line specifies that we want to retrieve the IDs of the research papers.

The `@en` language tag is used to specify that we want to retrieve the results in English. You can omit it if you want to retrieve the results in any other language. 

Please note that this is a simplified example and you may need to modify the query to fit your specific use case. 

Also, please note that the ORKG data dump is not provided here, you need to have access to it to run this query. 

Please let me know if you need any further assistance. 

Here's a sample use case:

Suppose we have a dataset that contains the following information:

| Research Paper ID | Title | Benchmark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| R147246 | Paper 1 | Benchmark 1 |
| R284317 | Paper 2 | Benchmark 2 |
| R123456 | Paper 3 | Benchmark 1 |

We can use the following SPARQL query to retrieve the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the TempEval-3 dataset:

```sparql
SELECT?paper?paperID 
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:includesBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:dataset?dataset.
 ?dataset ora:datasetName "TempEval-3 Dataset"@en.
 ?paper ora:ID?paperID.
}
```

This query will retrieve the following results:

| Research Paper ID | Title |
| --- | --- |
| R284317 | Paper 2 |

This is because the research paper with ID R284317 includes a benchmark for the TempEval-3 dataset, and the query retrieves the title and ID of this research paper. 

Please let me know if you need any further assistance. 

Here's another sample use case:

Suppose we have a dataset that contains the following information:

| Research Paper ID | Title | Benchmark | Dataset |
| --- | --- | --- |
