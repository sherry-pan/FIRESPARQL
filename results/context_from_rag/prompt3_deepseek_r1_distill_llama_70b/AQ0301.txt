Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What models are being evaluated on the WOS-11967 dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "models" and "WOS-11967 dataset". The property mentioned is "evaluated on". So, I need to look for these terms in the context data.

Looking at the context, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there's a resource R147652 which has steps related to a method involving SVM and MNIST. That might be relevant because it's about models and datasets. Then there's R147244 with a value of 93.9, which could be an evaluation score. R147246 has authors and a year, which might not be directly relevant but could be part of a paper that uses certain models.

Next, I need to find similar entities or properties. The question is about models evaluated on a specific dataset. In the context, I see mentions of "SVM" and "MNIST", which are a model and a dataset, respectively. There's also a mention of "CRF algorithm" in step 4, which is another model. The dataset "WOS-11967" isn't explicitly mentioned, but maybe it's related to other datasets like MNIST.

I should look for properties that connect models to datasets. The predicate P39020 describes steps, which might link models to their evaluations. Also, P27 lists authors, which could be part of papers that evaluate models on datasets.

Now, I'll try to match these to the extracted terms. For "models", the context has SVM and CRF. For "WOS-11967 dataset", since it's not present, I'll look for similar datasets like MNIST. The property "evaluated on" could correspond to P39020 or other evaluation-related predicates.

Putting this together, the candidates for "models" would include SVM and CRF. For the dataset, since WOS-11967 isn't there, I'll include MNIST as a similar dataset. The property "evaluated on" would link these models to the datasets they're tested on.

I need to structure this into JSON, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including URIs with the correct prefixes. Each candidate should have a URI, label, and type.

So, the final answer should list the models and the dataset, even if WOS-11967 isn't present, using the closest matches from the context.
