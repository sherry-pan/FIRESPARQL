Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the A3C LSTM hs model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P31?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P34?implementation.
      ?implementation orkgp:P5047?code.
      ?cont orkgp:P35?method.
       FILTER(REGEX(?method, "A3C LSTM hs"))
     }<|eot_id|>
