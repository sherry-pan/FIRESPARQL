Question:
Which sectors are modeled as energy sectors and how often?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/>
     SELECT?sector?frequency
     WHERE {
    ?s orkg:sector?sector.
    ?s orkg:energy?energy.
    ?s orkg:frequency?frequency.
     FILTER (?energy = "energy" ||?energy = "energy-sector" ||?energy = "sector-energy")
     GROUP BY?sector
     HAVING COUNT(?frequency) > 1
     }<|eot_id|>
