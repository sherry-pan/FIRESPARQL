Question:
List the code links in papers that use the Rfa-Gate-arccos model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
     PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/#>
     PREFIX orkp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/predicates/#>
     PREFIX orkc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/resource/#>
     PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/resource/#>

     SELECT?paper?code
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkp:hasCode?code
     AND?paper orkc:resource "R147246"
     AND?code orkp:hasBenchmark "R147246"
     }
     ```sparql

    The final answer is:

    ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/#>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/predicates/#>
    PREFIX orkc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/resource/#>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/resource/#>

    SELECT?paper?code
    WHERE {
   ?paper orkp:hasCode?code
    AND?paper orkc:resource "R147246"
    AND?code orkp:hasBenchmark "R147246"
    }
    ```sparql

Note: The final answer is the same as the provided SPARQL query. 

This problem requires you to generate a SPARQL query based on the provided context and input question. The context provides the entities and properties mentioned in the question, as well as candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to these entities and properties. The generated SPARQL query should be able to query the ORKG and retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 

The solution involves using the provided context to construct the SPARQL query. The query first selects the papers that use the Rfa-Gate-arccos model, and then filters the papers to only include those that have a code link. The code links are then filtered to only include those that have a benchmark, and the corresponding papers and code links are returned. 

Note that the solution assumes that the provided context is correct and complete, and that the ORKG is correctly implemented. In practice, you may need to modify the solution to handle additional cases or edge cases. 

The final answer is the generated SPARQL query, which is provided above. 

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if you'd like me to clarify any part of the solution. 

### Step 1: Define the prefixes for the ORKG and its predicates and resources.
```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/#>
PREFIX
