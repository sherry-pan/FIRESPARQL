Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Yelp Fine-grained classification dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "evaluation metrics" and "Yelp Fine-grained classification dataset". The property is "benchmarking models on".

Next, I'll look through the context information to find similar entities and properties. From the context, I see mentions of "validation research", "technique", and "Journal Article" which might relate to evaluation. There's also information about specific papers and their authors, but I'm focusing on metrics and datasets.

I notice that the context includes steps for a method involving NER and entity linking, which might use metrics like accuracy or F1-score. However, the specific dataset mentioned is "ACL Anthology", not Yelp, so I might need to infer based on similar datasets.

Since the Yelp dataset isn't directly mentioned, I'll consider general evaluation metrics used in classification tasks, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. These are common in benchmarking models.

Looking at the properties, "benchmarking models on" would relate to how models are evaluated on a dataset. In the context, there are predicates like P39020 which describe steps in a method, but I'll map "benchmarking" to a general property like "evaluation method".

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and the top candidates for each, using appropriate URIs and types based on the provided examples.
