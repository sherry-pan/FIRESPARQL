Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the All-attention network - 18 layers model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

    SELECT?uri?label?score?type
    WHERE {
     ?paper a orkgr:papers.
     ?paper orkgr:has_code_reference?code_ref.
     ?code_ref orkgr:has_model?model.
     ?model orkgr:has_benchmarking_purpose?purpose.
     ?paper orkgr:has DOI?doi.
     ?doi orkgr:has_uri?uri.
      FILTER (regex(str(?uri), "https?://doi\.org/.*") || regex(str(?uri), "https?://.*\\.pdf$"))
      BIND (regex(str(?uri), "https?://doi\.org/.*") AS?score)
      BIND (regex(str(?uri), "https?://.*\\.pdf$") AS?score)
    }
    ``` 
    Note that the DOIs are matched using regular expressions. The `regex` function is used to check if the URI contains a certain pattern. In this case, we're checking for DOIs and PDF links. The `BIND` function is used to assign the score to the URI. The `FILTER` clause is used to filter out URIs that don't match the pattern. 

    Please note that the SPARQL query is just a suggestion, and you might need to adjust it based on the actual structure of your data and the specific requirements of your use case. 

    The `PREFIX` clause is used to define the prefixes for the URIs. In this case, we're using `orkgr` and `orkgp` as prefixes for the ORKG RDF data. 

    The `SELECT` clause is used to specify the variables that we want to retrieve. In this case, we're retrieving the URI, label, score, and type of each resource. 

    The `WHERE` clause is used to specify the conditions under which we want to retrieve the resources. In this case, we're retrieving resources that are papers, have code references, have models, and have benchmarking purposes. We're also filtering out resources that don't have DOIs or PDF links. 

    The `FILTER` clause is used to apply filters to the results. In this case, we're using regular expressions to check if the URI contains a certain pattern. 

    The `BIND` clause is used to assign a value to a variable. In this case, we're assigning the score to the URI.
