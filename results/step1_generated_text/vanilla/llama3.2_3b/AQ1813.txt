    This query is based on the provided knowledge graph and uses the schema.org vocabulary to extract relevant information. The query starts by selecting the model, metric, and metric value. It then filters the results to only include the best performing model based on the Top-1 Accuracy metric. The LIMIT 1 clause is used to retrieve only the first result, which corresponds to the best performing model. 

    The query is based on the following assumptions:
    - The knowledge graph contains entities for models, metrics, and metric values.
    - The knowledge graph contains relationships between these entities, such as description, includes, name, and range.
    - The knowledge graph uses the schema.org vocabulary to provide additional metadata about the entities.
    - The best performing model is the one with the highest metric value.
    - The metric value is a float value that can be compared to determine the best performing model. 
    This query assumes that the knowledge graph is well-structured and follows the schema.org vocabulary. 

    The query is designed to be executed on the ORKG, and the results will be displayed in the format specified by the query. The results will include the model, metric, and metric value, with the metric value being the best performing model. 

    Please note that this query is a hypothetical example and may not work as-is on the actual ORKG. The actual query may need to be modified based on the specific structure and content of the knowledge graph. 

    The query is based on the following entities and relationships:
    - Model: has description, has label, has metric
    - Metric: has name, has range
    - Metric Value: has value
    - Relationship: has description, includes, has label, has metric, has metric value, has range

    The query uses the following schema.org properties:
    - schema:description
    - schema:includes
    - schema:name
    - schema:range
    - schema:description
    - schema:label
    - schema:description
    - schema:name 
    This query is a general example and may need to be modified based on the specific requirements of the ORKG.
