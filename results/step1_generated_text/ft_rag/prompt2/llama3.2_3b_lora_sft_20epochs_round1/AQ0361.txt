Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the SciERC dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_title
     WHERE {
       orkgr:R155561 {
         orkgrp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
         FILTER(?benchmark = "SciERC"^^xsd:string)
        ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
        ?dataset orkgp:P31?paper.
        ?paper orkgp:P5003?eval.
        ?eval orkgp:P5002?cont.
        ?cont orkgp:P5001?paper_title.
       }
     }<|eot_id|>
