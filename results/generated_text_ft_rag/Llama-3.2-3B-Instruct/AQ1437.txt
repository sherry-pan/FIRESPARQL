Question:
Which model has achieved the highest BLEU score score on the WMT2016 Romanian-English benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?benchmark orkgp:P31?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P32?eval.
      ?eval rdfs:label?eval_lbl.
       FILTER(REGEX(STR(?eval_lbl), "BLEU score_(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)", "i"))
      ?eval orkgp:P2755?model.
      ?model rdfs:label?model_lbl.
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(?eval_lbl) 
     LIMIT 1;     


```python
SELECT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
 ?benchmark orkgp:P31?cont.
 ?cont orkgp:P32?eval.
 ?eval rdfs:label?eval_lbl.
  FILTER(REGEX(STR(?eval_lbl), "BLEU score_(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)", "i"))
 ?eval orkgp:P2755?model.
 ?model rdfs:label?model_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?eval_lbl)
LIMIT 1;
```


## Step 1: Define the variables
We need to define the variables that we will use in our SPARQL query. We want to select the model and its label.

## Step 2: Find the relevant benchmarks
We need to find the benchmarks that match the WMT2016 Romanian-English benchmark. We can do this by using the orkgp:P31 and orkgp:P32 properties to find the evaluations that are related to the relevant benchmarks.

## Step 3: Filter the evaluations
We need to filter the evaluations to only include those with a label that contains the string "BLEU score_". We can use a regular expression to achieve this.

## Step 4: Get the model and its label
We need to get the model and its label from the filtered evaluations. We can use the orkgp:P2755 property to get the model and the rdfs:label property to get its label.

## Step 5: Order and limit the results
We need to order the results in descending order by the evaluation score and limit the results to one.

## Step 6: Execute the SPARQL query
We can execute the SPARQL query to get the desired results.

The final answer is: 
SELECT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
 ?benchmark orkgp:P31?cont.
 ?cont orkgp:P32?eval.
 ?eval rdfs:label?eval_lbl.
  FILTER(REGEX(STR(?eval_lbl), "BLEU score_(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)", "i"))
 ?eval orkgp:P2755?model.
 ?model rdfs:label?model_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?eval_lbl) 
LIMIT 1;

SELECT?model?model_lbl

 ?cont orkgp:P32?eval.

 ?eval orkgp:P2755?model.
 ?model rdfs:label?model_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?eval_lbl)
LIMIT 1;
