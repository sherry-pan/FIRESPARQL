Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the Gibson PointGoal Navigation benchmark dataset. The question is about listing the metrics used, so I should focus on properties related to evaluation, benchmarks, and metrics.

First, I'll look through the JSON properties. I see several that have labels like "evaluation", "benchmark", "metric", etc. For example, "evaluation" is a clear fit because it directly relates to assessing model performance. "Has benchmark" is also relevant since the question mentions a specific benchmark dataset.

Next, I notice properties like "Recall", "Accuracy", "micro-F1", and "macro-F1". These are all common evaluation metrics used in machine learning, so they should be included. "NDCG@10" is another metric, though it's more specific to ranking tasks, but it's still a relevant evaluation measure.

I also see "has training set" and "validation set". While these are more about data splits than metrics, they are part of the evaluation process, so they might be useful in understanding how the model was trained and validated on the benchmark.

Other properties like "has dataset" and "data splitting method" provide context about the dataset itself, which could be useful when discussing evaluation on that dataset.

I should make sure to include all these properties as they each contribute to understanding the evaluation process and metrics used on the Gibson dataset.
