Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the DQN-PixelCNN model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?code
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:Paper.
 ?paper ora:hasPaper?paper1.
 ?paper1 ora:hasAuthor?author.
 ?paper1 ora:hasVenue?venue.
 ?paper1 ora:utilizes?dqn.
 ?dqn ora:hasCode?code.
 ?code ora:link?link.
 ?link a ora:Code.
}
``` 
    Note: The provided SPARQL query is just an example and might need to be adjusted according to the actual data in the ORKG.

    The SPARQL query provided is based on the following assumptions:
    - The entities and properties in the question are linked to the corresponding entities and properties in the ORKG.
    - The "papers" entity in the question is linked to the "hasPaper" predicate in the ORKG.
    - The "utilized" entity in the question is linked to the "utilizes" predicate in the ORKG.
    - The "links to their code" entity in the question is linked to the "hasCode" predicate in the ORKG.
    - The "code" entity in the question is linked to the "Code" class in the ORKG.
    - The "link" entity in the question is linked to the "link" predicate in the ORKG.
    - The "paper" entity in the question is linked to the "Paper" class in the ORKG.
    - The "author" entity in the question is linked to the "hasAuthor" predicate in the ORKG.
    - The "venue" entity in the question is linked to the "hasVenue" predicate in the ORKG.

    These assumptions might not be correct, and the actual SPARQL query might need to be adjusted according to the actual data in the ORKG. 

    Also, the provided SPARQL query is just one possible solution, and there might be other possible solutions according to the actual data in the ORKG. 

    If you need further assistance or clarification, please let me know.
