Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the SemExp model for benchmarking purposes?" using the provided ORKG RDF data.

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The key entities here are "code references," "papers," and "SemExp model." The action is "used for benchmarking purposes."

Looking through the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates related to models, datasets, and papers. For example, R147652 describes a method involving SVM and MNIST, and there are mentions of entities like "models," "benchmark," and "evaluation."

I need to find entities related to "code references." In the context, I don't see any direct mentions of code, but there are terms like "public deliversables" and "keyphrase extraction" which might be related to where code is mentioned in papers.

Next, for "papers," the context has resources like R147246 and R283710, which are papers with authors and venues. These could be the sources where code references are found.

The "SemExp model" isn't explicitly mentioned, but there are models like SVM and methods involving NER approaches. I might need to infer that "SemExp" could relate to semantic expansion methods, possibly linked to models used in the steps described.

For benchmarking purposes, the context mentions "benchmark" in the analysis section and has predicates like P5044 (Journal Article) and P41924 (scholarly domain). These could be relevant when looking for benchmarking contexts.

Now, I'll map these extracted terms to the RDF data. "Code references" might relate to "public deliversables" or "keyphrase extraction." "Papers" can be linked to resources like R147246 and R283710. The "SemExp model" could be associated with methods like those in R147652, which uses SciBERT and k-means.

I'll look for properties that connect these entities. For example, P27 links authors to papers, and P31 links resources to their types. HAS_VENUE and HAS_VALUE might also be useful in finding where these papers were published or their metrics.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their top candidates from the RDF data. Each term will have a list of URIs with their labels and types based on the context provided.
