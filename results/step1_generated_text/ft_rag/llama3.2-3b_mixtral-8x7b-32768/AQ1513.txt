Question:
What is the name of the top performing model in terms of A2 score when benchmarked on the ANLI test dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "ANLI test dataset")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.

       ORDER BY DESC(?A2_lbl)
      ?model      orkgp:P31               ?cont1.
      ?cont1      rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
