Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking for a list of papers that have used the "Duel hs model" and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information to find any relevant data. The context has two main sections, each containing RDF triples. 

Looking at the first section, I see that it describes a resource R147652, which outlines a method involving steps like seed terms, expansion, annotation, NER approach, and filtering. The steps mention using SciBERT and a CRF algorithm. There are also some predicates related to authors and publication details, like P27 for authors and P29 for the year. However, I don't see any mention of the "Duel hs model" here.

The second section describes another resource, R284316, which is a journal article about extracting entity knowledge using a model called jpark. It mentions tools like Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL. Again, there's no reference to the "Duel hs model."

Since the context doesn't mention the "Duel hs model" at all, I can't extract any relevant papers or code links from it. Therefore, the answer should indicate that no relevant information was found in the provided data.

Based on the provided context, there is no information related to the "Duel hs model" or any associated papers and code links. The context discusses other models and methods, such as jpark, but does not mention the "Duel hs model."
