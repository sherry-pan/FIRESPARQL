Question:
What models are being evaluated on the TempEval-3 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?dataset orkggc:hasDataset?model.
  filter (rdfs:label?dataset = "TempEval-3").
  filter (rdfs:label?model = "models").
}
```
    Note that the prefix declarations are not part of the final answer. Assume that the prefix declarations are already defined elsewhere in the query.

    Also, note that the answer to the question "What models are being evaluated on the TempEval-3 dataset?" is "models that have TempEval-3 as their dataset", which is already included in the provided SPARQL query. 
    Therefore, this query already provides the correct answer to the question. 

    Please do not add any additional logic to the query. 

    The final answer is the provided SPARQL query. 

    If you want to get the dataset that models are being evaluated on, the query should be modified to only select?dataset. 

    The final answer is: 
    ```sparql
    ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?dataset orkggc:hasDataset?model.
  filter (rdfs:label?dataset = "TempEval-3").
  filter (rdfs:label?model = "models").
}
```sparql
    ) as text. 

    Note: I have assumed that the provided SPARQL query is correct and it already provides the correct answer to the question. If there are any errors in the query, it should be corrected. 

    Also, note that the provided SPARQL query uses the predicates `orkgc:hasDataset`, `rdfs:label`, and `rdf:type` to query the ORKG. These predicates are not explicitly mentioned in the context, but they are assumed to be available in the ORKG. 

    If the predicates are not available in the ORKG, the query would need to be modified accordingly. 

    The final answer is the provided SPARQL query. 

    Please do not add any additional logic to the query.
