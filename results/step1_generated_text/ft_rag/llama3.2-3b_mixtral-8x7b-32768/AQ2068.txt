Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the DCN model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?code
WHERE {
 ?model    orkgc:R151231    a            orkgc:Model;
            rdfs:label      ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "DCN")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:P2   ?model.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK   ?benchmark;
                  orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
  OPTIONAL {?cont      orkgp:HAS_CODE       ?code.}
}
```sparql
    Note: The orkggc and orkgp prefixes are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the SPARQL query. This query retrieves code references in papers that have used the DCN model for benchmarking purposes. The query filters papers that have used the DCN model for benchmarking purposes. For each paper that has used the DCN model for benchmarking purposes, the query checks if the paper has code references. If the paper has code references, the query includes the code references in the output. 

    The query uses the following properties and predicates from the ORKG:
    - orkgc:Model (model)
    - orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK (benchmarking)
    - orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION (evaluation)
    - orkgp:HAS_CODE (code reference)
    - orkgp:P2 (used_for)
    - rdfs:label (model label)
    - a (type)
    - str (string function) 
    - FILTER (filter function) 

    The query uses the following entities and resources from the ORKG:
    - DCN model
    - papers
    - code references
    - benchmarking purposes
    - evaluation purposes
    - model label
    - model type
    - contribution type
    - contribution resource
    - contribution paper
    - orkg:R151231 (model)
    - orkg:R122689 (DCN model)
    - orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK (benchmarking)
    - orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION (evaluation)
    - orkgp:HAS_CODE (code reference)
    - orkgp:P2 (used_for)
    - rdfs:label (model label)
    - a (type)
    - str (string function) 
    - FILTER (filter function)
