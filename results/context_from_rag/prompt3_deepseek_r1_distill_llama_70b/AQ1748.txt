Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What is the name of the top performing model in terms of NLL score when benchmarked on the Nottingham dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The key entities and properties mentioned are "top performing model," "NLL score," and "Nottingham dataset." The properties involved here are "benchmark on" and "NLL score."

Next, I need to find similar entities or properties in the RDF data. Looking through the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates related to models, datasets, and performance metrics. For example, there's a resource R147652 which describes a method involving SVM and MNIST, and another resource R283709 which mentions "Named entity recognition" and "Graph analytics." 

I also notice that there are properties like P39020 which seems to describe steps in a method, and P27 which lists authors. However, I'm looking for terms related to models, datasets, and NLL scores. Since the context doesn't explicitly mention "NLL score" or "Nottingham dataset," I'll have to infer based on similar terms.

For "top performing model," I can look for resources that are models or have high performance metrics. In the context, R147652 is associated with SVM and MNIST, which are related to models and datasets. R283709 talks about "Named entity recognition" and "Graph analytics," which might be relevant to models.

For "NLL score," since it's not directly mentioned, I might look for performance metrics or evaluation methods. The context has resources like R147244 with a value of "93.9," which could be a performance score, but it's not clear what it represents.

Regarding "Nottingham dataset," the context mentions "MNIST" and other datasets, but not Nottingham. So I might have to consider that the dataset isn't present and perhaps the closest is MNIST or another benchmark dataset.

Now, I need to map these extracted terms to the RDF data. For "top performing model," the closest resources are R147652 and R283709. For "NLL score," there's no direct match, but R147244 has a value which could be a score. For "Nottingham dataset," since it's not present, I might have to leave it out or find a related dataset.

Putting this together, the candidates for "top performing model" would include R147652 and R283709. For "NLL score," R147244 is a possible candidate. Since "Nottingham dataset" isn't present, I might not include it or note that it's not found.

I should structure the JSON output as specified, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including URIs with appropriate prefixes. Each candidate should have a URI, label, and type.

So, the final JSON would list the candidates for each extracted term, ensuring that the URIs use the correct prefixes like "orkgr:" for resources and "orkgp:" for properties. Since "Nottingham dataset" isn't found, its candidates list would be empty.
