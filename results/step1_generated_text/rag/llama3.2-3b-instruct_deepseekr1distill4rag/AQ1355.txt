Question:
Can you provide the highest benchmark result, including the metric and score, for the Sequential MNIST dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

    SELECT?metric?score WHERE {
     ?dataset a orkgc:Resource.
     ?dataset orkgr:label "Sequential MNIST dataset"@en.
     ?dataset orkgp:has_benchmark_result?result.
     ?result orkgp:metric?metric.
     ?result orkgp:score?score.
      BIND(str(?metric) AS?metricLabel).
      BIND(str(?score) AS?scoreLabel).
    }

    This output is the SPARQL query that corresponds to the provided input question and context. The query is designed to retrieve the highest benchmark result, including the metric and score, for the Sequential MNIST dataset from the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). The query uses the specified prefixes and variables to navigate the RDF data and extract the required information. 

    Please note that the actual URIs and prefixes used in the query may vary depending on the actual RDF data structure and the specific requirements of the ORKG. 

    The query is structured to first identify the Sequential MNIST dataset, then retrieve the benchmark result associated with it, and finally extract the metric and score from the result. The BIND function is used to create labels for the metric and score variables, which can be used to display the results in a more human-readable format. 

    The query assumes that the RDF data is organized in a way that allows for the specified navigation and retrieval of the required information. If the actual data structure differs, the query may need to be adjusted accordingly. 

    Additionally, the query does not include any filtering or sorting clauses, which may be necessary depending on the specific requirements of the application. 

    The query is designed to be executed on a SPARQL query engine, such as Apache Jena or Virtuoso, to retrieve the results. 

    Please note that the actual output of the query may vary depending on the actual RDF data and the specific requirements of the application.
