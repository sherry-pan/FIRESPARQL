Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the MEMEN (single model) model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql

    Note that this response is not a solution to a programming problem but rather a response to a specific task given in the prompt. The response is a SPARQL query designed to query the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) for the given input question. 

    The SPARQL query is based on the context provided and the terms mentioned in the question. It uses the `orkgc` and `orkgp` prefixes to refer to the entities and properties in the ORKG. The query retrieves papers that have a contribution that has been evaluated as a benchmark and also has a label that matches the MEMEN (single model) model. It then filters the results to only include papers that have a resource with a URI that matches "https://example.org/orkgr/R147244". The `str(?uri) = "https://example.org/orkgr/R147244"` filter is used to check if the URI matches the specified value. 

    The query is designed to provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the MEMEN (single model) model as requested in the input question. 

    Note that the actual URIs used in the query may vary depending on the actual data in the ORKG. 

    The context provided includes candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The `candidates` object contains lists of candidate entities and properties, including the `MEMEN (single model) model`, `papers`, `benchmark`, and `code`. 

    The `ori` prefix is used to
