To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined:

1. **Extract entities and properties from the question**: The question is "What models are being evaluated on the UrbanSound8k dataset?" The key entities or properties that can be extracted from this question are "models" and "UrbanSound8k dataset".

2. **Retrieve similar entities or properties from the RDF data dump**: Since the provided RDF data dump does not directly mention "UrbanSound8k dataset" or specific models being evaluated on it, we will have to look for entities or properties that are related to the concepts of "models" and "datasets" in a broader sense. 

Given the nature of the task and the data provided, we'll proceed with a general approach to identify entities that could be related to the question, focusing on those labeled as "Resource" or more specific types like "Contribution", "Venue", or "Comparison", as these might contain information about models or datasets.

3. **Calculate cosine similarity scores**: For simplicity, we'll consider the labels of the entities and calculate the cosine similarity between these labels and the key terms extracted from the question ("models", "UrbanSound8k dataset"). This step requires a basic understanding of natural language processing (NLP) and the ability to calculate cosine similarity, typically using vector representations of words or phrases.

Given the constraints and the data provided, let's identify some entities that could be relevant based on their labels:

- **R76234**: Labeled as "BabelEnconding", which doesn't directly relate to models or datasets but is a resource.
- **R76243**: Labeled as "looked at different ways to measure similarity between embeddings, mixing euclidean distance with the most common cosine similarity and several others", which mentions similarity and could be tangentially related to evaluating models.
- **R76244**: Labeled as "Team 2 Subtask 1 English", which could be related to a specific task or model evaluation.
- **R75430**: Labeled as "IBM Journal of Research and Development", a venue that could publish research on models or datasets.
- **R75431**: Labeled as "Contribution 1", which is vague but could potentially relate to a contribution in the field of model evaluation.
- **R75840**: Labeled as "Factors influencing evidence-based decision-making in humanitarian response", which is somewhat related to the concept of evaluation.
- **R44252**: Labeled as "BioBERT achieved the highest F1 scores", directly mentioning a model (BioBERT) and its evaluation (achieving the highest F1 scores).

Calculating cosine similarity would typically involve converting these labels into numerical vectors (e.g., using word embeddings like Word2Vec or GloVe) and then comparing these vectors to the vector representation of the question. However, without specific tools or libraries mentioned, we'll proceed conceptually.

**Conceptual Similarity Calculation**:
- **R76243**, **R44252** might have higher similarity scores due to their direct or indirect mention of model evaluation or performance metrics.
- **R76244**, **R75431** could have moderate similarity due to their potential relevance to tasks or contributions that might involve model evaluation, though their labels are not directly informative.
- **R75430** might have a lower similarity score since it's more about a publication venue than a specific model or dataset.

**Output**:
Given the nature of the task and the data, a precise calculation of cosine similarity isn't feasible without further processing tools. However, we can conceptually rank entities based on their relevance to the question:

```json
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R44252",
    "label": "BioBERT achieved the highest F1 scores",
    "score": 0.8
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R76243",
    "label": "looked at different ways to measure similarity between embeddings, mixing euclidean distance with the most common cosine similarity and several others",
    "score": 0.7
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R76244",
    "label": "Team 2 Subtask 1 English",
    "score": 0.4
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R75431",
    "label": "Contribution 1",
    "score": 0.3
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R75430",
    "label": "IBM Journal of Research and Development",
    "score": 0.2
  }
]
```

Note: The scores are hypothetical and based on a conceptual understanding of the task. Actual scores would depend on the specific method used for calculating cosine similarity.
