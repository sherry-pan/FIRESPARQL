Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the ImageNet 64x64 benchmark dataset. The question is about metrics used in evaluation, so I should look for properties related to evaluation, metrics, or performance measurement.

Looking through the JSON, I see several properties that stand out. First, "evaluation" with the label "evaluation" seems directly relevant because it's a general term that would cover various metrics. Then, "Recall" is a common metric in machine learning, so that's a good fit. "Accuracy" is another fundamental metric used across many benchmarks, including ImageNet. "macro-F1" and "micro-F1" are specific F1 scores which are important for classification tasks, so they should be included. "NDCG@10" is a ranking metric that might be used in such benchmarks as well. 

I also notice properties like "has benchmark" and "has dataset," but these seem more about the existence of benchmarks rather than the specific metrics used. Therefore, I'll focus on the ones that are actual metrics. Each of these properties directly relates to how model performance is measured, making them the most relevant for the question.
