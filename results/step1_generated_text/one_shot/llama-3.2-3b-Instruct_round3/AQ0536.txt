Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Walker, walk (DMControl100k) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paperID
    WHERE {
     ?benchmark       orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARKED?paper.
     ?benchmark       a                orkgp:Benchmark;
                      orkgp:NAME         ?benchmark_lbl.
      FILTER (str(?benchmark_lbl) = "Walker, walk (DMControl100k)")
     ?paper          orkgp:HAS_PAPER      ?paper.
     ?paper          orkgp:ID              ?paperID.
    }<|eot_id|>
