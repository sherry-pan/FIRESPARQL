Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question about papers using the Table-Sequence model and their code links. Let me start by understanding the question. The user is asking for a list of papers that have used the Table-Sequence model and wants links to their code. 

Looking at the JSON example, I see properties like "method", "implementation", "evaluation", etc. The question is about identifying papers, so I should focus on properties that relate to papers, methods, and code. 

First, "method" seems relevant because it refers to the approach or model used, which in this case is the Table-Sequence model. Next, "implementation" is important because it likely points to how the method was applied, possibly including code. 

"evaluation" could be useful as it might contain information on how the model was tested, which sometimes includes code or links to repositories. "has dataset" might be relevant if the papers used specific datasets, but it's a bit less directly related to the code. 

I should also consider if there are properties related to code or links, but in the provided JSON, "implementation" seems to be the closest. So, I'll include "method", "implementation", and "evaluation" as the most relevant properties.

The most relevant properties from the JSON file that could help answer the question about papers using the Table-Sequence model and their code links are:

[
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_METHOD",
    "label": "method",
    "reason": "This property is relevant because it refers to the method or model used in the paper, which in this case is the Table-Sequence model."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_IMPLEMENTATION",
    "label": "implementation",
    "reason": "This property is relevant because it refers to the implementation details of the method, which could include links to code or repositories."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_EVALUATION",
    "label": "evaluation",
    "reason": "This property is relevant because it refers to the evaluation of the method, which may include information about the papers or links to additional resources."
  }
]
