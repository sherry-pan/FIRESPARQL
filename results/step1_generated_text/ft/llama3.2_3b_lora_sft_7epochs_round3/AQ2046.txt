Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the MMV model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
        ?paper orkgp:P30_...?cont.
        ?cont. orkgp:P31_...?code.
         FILTER(REGEX(?code, "MMV"))
         FILTER(?code!= "")
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(?paper orkgp:P31_...)
     LIMIT 10<|eot_id|>
