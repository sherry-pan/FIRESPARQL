SELECT ?paper ?title ?code
WHERE {
  ?paper wdt:PXX ?sacModel.  # Replace PXX with the correct property for SAC model utilization
  ?paper wdt:P171 ?code.     # Assuming P171 is the property for code links
  ?paper rdfs:label ?title.
  FILTER (CONTAINS(LCASE(?title), "sac model"))
}
LIMIT 10
```

Note: The placeholders `PXX` and `P171` need to be replaced with the correct property IDs. The query assumes that papers are linked to the SAC model with a specific property and that the code links are specified with another property. Adjust these according to your specific ontology.
