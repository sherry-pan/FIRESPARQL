Okay, so I need to figure out which model has the highest BLEU score on the WMT2016 Romanian-English benchmark. Let me start by looking at the context provided.

First, I see that there are several resources listed. Each resource has a URI, a type, and a label. The types are either Benchmark or Evaluation. The labels for the benchmarks mention specific WMT years and language pairs, like "Benchmark WMT2016 English-Romanian" and others. The evaluations have labels like "Evaluation BLEU score_29.79".

I need to focus on the WMT2016 Romanian-English benchmark. Looking through the context, I find two benchmarks that match this: R129763 and R129753. Both are labeled as "Benchmark WMT2016 English-Romanian". Wait, but the question is about Romanian-English, which is the same as English-Romanian, just reversed. So these are the relevant benchmarks.

Next, I need to find the evaluations associated with these benchmarks. Evaluations have URIs like R129764, R129754, etc. Each evaluation has a BLEU score in its label. For example, R129764 has a score of 29.79, and R129754 has 30.74.

Since the question is about the highest BLEU score, I should compare these scores. Between R129764 (29.79) and R129754 (30.74), the higher score is 30.74. Therefore, the model associated with R129754 would be the one with the highest BLEU score on the WMT2016 Romanian-English benchmark.

I should also check if there are any other evaluations linked to these benchmarks, but from the context provided, these are the only two. So the top score is 30.74.

To determine which model achieved the highest BLEU score on the WMT2016 Romanian-English benchmark, we examine the evaluations associated with the relevant benchmarks. The benchmark "Benchmark WMT2016 English-Romanian" (R129763 and R129753) has evaluations with BLEU scores of 29.79 (R129764) and 30.74 (R129754). The highest score is 30.74.

**Answer:**

The model associated with the evaluation "Evaluation BLEU score_30.74" (R129754) achieved the highest BLEU score of 30.74 on the WMT2016 Romanian-English benchmark.
