Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the Walker, walk (DMControl500k) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Walker, walk (DMControl500k)")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                 rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?paper_lbl_rbl)
LIMIT 10
```



    Note: The original response is not included in the output as it is not relevant to the task. The task is to generate the SPARQL query based on the provided input question and context. The output is the generated SPARQL query. 

    Please note that the SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG RDF data. The query above is based on the provided context and may not work as-is in the actual data. 

    The actual output may vary based on the data, but the query should be able to retrieve the correct results based on the provided context.
