Question:
What is the name of the top performing model in terms of Top-1 Error Rate score when benchmarked on the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>

SELECT?model?score
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?topModel.
 ?topModel orkgp:HAS_SCORE?score.
 ?model orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?evaluation.
  FILTER (?evaluation orkgr:R122689 ).
 ?score orkgp:TOP_1_ERROR_RATE.
}
``` 
    Note that you will need to replace the PREFIX declarations with the actual URIs of the prefixes in your knowledge graph. The actual URIs may be different from the ones used in this example.
    You may need to add additional constraints to the query based on the actual structure of your knowledge graph. The query provided above is just a starting point.
    You can query the knowledge graph with the SPARQL query above to get the desired answer. The answer will be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the name of the top performing model and its corresponding Top-1 Error Rate score. 
    Please note that the actual answer may not be a single tuple, but rather a list of tuples. 

    In the provided context, the candidate entity "Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset" is linked to two URIs, "orkgr:R122689". The filter condition in the query is set to only include evaluations that are linked to this URI. The query will return the Top-1 Error Rate score for the top performing model that was evaluated on this dataset. 
    The actual answer will depend on the structure of the knowledge graph and the actual data stored in it. 

    The answer will be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the name of the top performing model and its corresponding Top-1 Error Rate score. 

    Please note that the actual answer may not be a single tuple, but rather a list of tuples. 

    The actual answer will depend on the structure of the knowledge graph and the actual data stored in it. 

    The provided context includes the following information:
    1. Terms (entities and properties) mentioned in the question.
    2. Candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
