Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question "What are the metrics of evaluation over the ObjectNet dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "metrics of evaluation" and "ObjectNet dataset." The property implied is "evaluated on" or something similar that connects metrics to the dataset.

Looking at the context data, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there's a resource R147652 which has multiple steps described, but I'm not sure if that's relevant here. Then there are resources like R147244, R147246, and others that seem to be about publications and their details. R283709 and R283710 also talk about papers, with keywords like "Graph analytics" and "Named entity recognition."

I need to find entities related to "metrics of evaluation" and "ObjectNet dataset." In the data, I see mentions of "HAS_VALUE" and "HAS_VENUE," but I'm not sure if those are metrics. There's also a mention of "evaluation" in the context of a method, like "HAS_EVALUATION" as a predicate.

Wait, in the example provided, the expected output includes "evaluated on" mapped to "orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION." So maybe I should look for similar predicates here. Also, the example had "models" and "tested on," which might relate to how metrics are applied to datasets.

Looking through the context, I see that R147652 has steps involving NER approaches and CRF algorithms, which might be methods but not directly metrics. The other resources like R283709 mention "method," "solution proposal," and "entity extraction," which could be related but not exactly metrics.

I'm not seeing any direct mention of "ObjectNet dataset" in the provided context. The example used "MPQA benchmark dataset," but here I need to find something similar. Since it's not present, maybe I can infer or look for related datasets or metrics.

Wait, maybe "ObjectNet" isn't in the data, so I might have to consider that the answer could be empty or not found. But the example included some entries even if they weren't exact matches, so perhaps I should look for any dataset-related resources.

Looking again, I see R147244 has a value of "93.9," which might be a metric, but it's not clear what it's for. R283709 has keywords like "Graph analytics" and "Named entity recognition," which are methods, not metrics.

I think I need to structure the answer by extracting the terms "metrics of evaluation" and "ObjectNet dataset." Then, for each, find the top candidates from the RDF data. Since "ObjectNet" isn't present, maybe I can look for any dataset-related resources or metrics-related predicates.

In the context, the predicates like P39020 describe steps, which might not be metrics. The resources R147246 and R283710 are about papers and their authors, not directly related to metrics or datasets.

So, perhaps the candidates for "metrics of evaluation" could include any resources that have values or are related to evaluation, like R147244 with "93.9." For "ObjectNet dataset," since it's not present, maybe there are no direct matches, but perhaps other datasets like "MNIST" mentioned in step 1 of R147652.

Wait, in the first part of the context, R147652's step 1 mentions "SVM" and "MNIST" as seed terms. So maybe "MNIST" is a dataset. Therefore, for "ObjectNet dataset," the closest might be "MNIST," but it's not the same. Alternatively, maybe there's a predicate that connects datasets to evaluations.

In the example, "tested on" was mapped to "orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION." So perhaps "evaluated on" would also map to that predicate. Therefore, for "metrics of evaluation," I might include "orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION" as a property.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the extracted terms and their candidates. Since "ObjectNet dataset" isn't in the data, its candidates might be empty or include any dataset resources available, like "MNIST" from R147652.

I think I've gathered enough to form the JSON response, even if some parts aren't directly matching the query.
