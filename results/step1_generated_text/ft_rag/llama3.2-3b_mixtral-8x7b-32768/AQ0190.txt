Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the ShARe/CLEF eHealth corpus dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
           FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "ShARe/CLEF eHealth corpus dataset")
          ?cont         orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
          ?eval         orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION    ?cont.
          ?model       orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?eval;
                      rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
     }
     ORDER BY?model_lbl
     LIMIT 10

74375            rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
