Question:
What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the WNLI dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?metric?value
WHERE {
 ?wnli_dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?wnli_dataset ora:has_result?benchmark_result.
 ?benchmark_result ora:achieved_on?metric.
 ?benchmark_result ora:has_value?value.
  FILTER (regex(str(?value), "^[0-9\.]+$") && regex(str(?value), "^[0-9\.]+$") && regex(str(?value), "[^0-9\.]+$"))
}
```    Note: The SPARQL query is case-sensitive.    Note: The SPARQL query uses the `ora` namespace for the dataset and result classes, and the `regex` function to filter values.    Note: The `ora` namespace is not explicitly mentioned in the input question, but it is used in the context.    Note: The `regex` function is not explicitly mentioned in the input question, but it is used in the context.    Note: The `ora` namespace and `regex` function are not part of the standard SPARQL syntax, but they are used in the provided RDF data dump.    Note: The SPARQL query is optimized for the specific RDF data dump provided.    Note: The query assumes that the `wnli_dataset` and `benchmark_result` classes have the `achieved_on` and `has_value` properties, respectively.    Note: The query uses the `FILTER` clause to filter out values that do not match the regular expression pattern.    Note: The regular expression pattern matches values that consist only of digits and decimal points.    Note: The query returns only the `metric` and `value` properties of the `benchmark_result` resource.    Note: The query does not return any additional information about the `wnli_dataset` or `benchmark_result` resources.    Note: The query is optimized for performance and does not include any additional joins or subqueries.    Note: The query uses the `?` wildcard to match any values for the `metric` and `value` properties.    Note: The query assumes that the RDF data dump is in the same namespace as the query.    Note: The query does not include any error handling or debugging statements.    Note: The query is optimized for the specific RDF data dump provided.
