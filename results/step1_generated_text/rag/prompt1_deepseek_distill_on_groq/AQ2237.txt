Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given context. The query is asking for a list of papers that used the BCN+ELMo model and include links to their code. 

First, I should look through the provided ORKG RDF data to find any mentions of the BCN+ELMo model. Scanning through the context, I see various resources like R76234 labeled "BabelEnconding", R76243 talking about similarity measures, R76244 as "Team 2 Subtask 1 English", and so on. 

I don't see any direct mention of "BCN+ELMo" in the context. The resources listed are about different topics like Named Entity Recognition, venues like IBM Journal, and contributions. None of these seem related to the specific model in the query.

Since the context doesn't contain information about the BCN+ELMo model or any related papers, I can't retrieve any similar entities or properties. Therefore, the top 5 similar entities would be an empty list because there's no relevant data to match the query.

The query asks for papers using the BCN+ELMo model, but the provided context doesn't mention this model. Therefore, no relevant entities are found.
