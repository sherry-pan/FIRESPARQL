Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only) benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?modelLabel
    WHERE {
   ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?m.  # models have a model
   ?m orkgp:label?modelLabel.  # models have a label
   ?model orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?e.  # models have an evaluation
   ?e orkgp:evaluationType?evalType.  # evaluations have an evaluation type
   ?e orkgp:evaluationDataset?evalDataset.  # evaluations have an evaluation dataset
   ?evalDataset orkgp:label?evalDatasetLabel.  # evaluations have a label
   ?e orkgp:hasEvaluationDataset?evalDataset.  # evaluations have an evaluation dataset
   ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?m.  # models have a model
   ?m orkgp:label?modelLabel.  # models have a label
    FILTER (STR(?evalDatasetLabel) = "NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only) benchmark dataset")
    }
    LIMIT 1000
    
    Note: The SPARQL query is expected to be in the format of the original query that would be used to query the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). 

    Please note that the query might not be optimal for performance but is correct in terms of retrieving the answer to the input question. 

    The SPARQL query is expected to be in a fixed format. 
    Do not add any additional logic or complex SPARQL queries. 
    Please keep in mind that the query might need to be adjusted based on the actual data in the ORKG.
