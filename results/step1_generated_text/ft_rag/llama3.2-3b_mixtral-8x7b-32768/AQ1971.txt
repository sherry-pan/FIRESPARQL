Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the CRF with sentence expansion model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code?code_lbl
     WHERE {
         orkgp:Contributions rdfs:label orkgp:P36;
             orkgp:P47 orkgp:Contributions.
        ?cont orkgp:HAS_CONTRIB.?cont orkgp:P47?r.
        ?cont orkgp:P36?cont orkgp:HAS_PAPER.?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?cont.
        ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
         FILTER(REGEX(STR(?code), "https?://"))
        ?code orkgp:HAS_CODE?code_lbl.
     }
