Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the arXiv dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl (COUNT(?benchmark) AS?benchmark_cnt) 
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a            orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "arXiv")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
      ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                      rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
     } GROUP BY?paper?paper_lbl HAVING (COUNT(?benchmark) >= 1) ORDER BY DESC(?benchmark_cnt) LIMIT 5.``` 
    Note: The above SPARQL query is a simplified version and may not be optimal for performance. It is intended to illustrate the process of generating a query based on the provided natural language question and context. In a real-world scenario, you may need to optimize the query for performance and accuracy. 

    The above query works as follows:
    - It first filters the datasets to only include those labeled as "arXiv".
    - Then, it retrieves the papers that have a benchmark (i.e., a resource that has a HAS_DATASET property with a value that is a dataset with the label "arXiv").
    - It then retrieves the labels of these papers.
    - Finally, it groups the results by paper and label, and filters the results to only include papers that have at least one benchmark (i.e., a paper that has a benchmark).
    - The results are ordered by the number of benchmarks in descending order, and the top 5 results are returned. 

    Please note that the query assumes that the RDF data is stored in a format that can be queried using SPARQL. In a real-world scenario, you may need to modify the query to accommodate the specific format and structure of your RDF data. 

    Also, the query uses the `COUNT` aggregation function to count the number of benchmarks for each paper. This is done to filter out papers that do not have any benchmarks. 

    The query also uses the `GROUP BY` clause to group the results by paper and label. This is done to ensure that the results are returned in a meaningful way, with each paper and its corresponding label. 

    Finally, the query uses the `HAVING` clause to filter the results to only include papers that have at least one benchmark. This is done to ensure that only papers that are relevant to the query are returned. 

    The `LIMIT` clause is used to limit the number of results returned to the top 5. 

    The `ORDER BY` clause is used to order the results in descending order based on the number of benchmarks. 

    The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include papers that have a benchmark. 

    The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group the results by paper and label. 

    The `HAVING` clause is used to filter the results to only include papers that have at least one benchmark.
