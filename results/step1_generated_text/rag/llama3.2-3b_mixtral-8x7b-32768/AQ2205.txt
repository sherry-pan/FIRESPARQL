Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the NASCell model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX foaf: <http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/>

SELECT?paper?benchmark?code?link
WHERE {
 ?paper a orkg:Contribution.
 ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkg:hasCode?code.
 ?code orkg:hasLink?link.
  FILTER (STRContains(STR(?benchmark), "NASCell"))
  FILTER (STRContains(STR(?paper), "benchmark"))
  FILTER (STRContains(STR(?code), "NASCell"))
}
``` 
    Note: The link to the answer is not provided here as it is generated based on the query.
    It is expected that the answer will be retrieved from the ORKG.
    The SPARQL query is designed to be executed on the ORKG.

    The SPARQL query is designed to answer the question by filtering papers that have benchmarked the NASCell model, 
    and for each of these papers, it filters the benchmarked code that also contains the NASCell model. 
    The query then retrieves the links to this code.

    The query uses the following properties:
    * `orkg:Contribution`: represents a scholarly contribution.
    * `orkg:hasBenchmark`: represents a benchmarking relation between contributions.
    * `orkg:hasCode`: represents a code relation between contributions.
    * `orkg:hasLink`: represents a link relation between codes.
    * `rdfs:label
