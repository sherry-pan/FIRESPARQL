Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the SciERC benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
     PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
     PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
     PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
     SELECT?model?resource
     WHERE {
      ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?resource.
       FILTER (bif:contains(str(?resource), "orkgr:R147244") && bif:contains(str(?resource), "orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION") && bif:contains(str(?resource), "orkgp:HAS_MODEL"))
       }
     ```
    Note that the actual prefix declarations and the query output might vary based on the actual data in the ORKG.
    This is a machine translation from the provided prompt. 

    ## Step 1: Understand the context and the question
    We are given a natural language question and some context that includes extracted terms, candidates, and a list of prefixes for the SPARQL query.

    ## Step 2: Identify the relevant terms and entities in the question
    The relevant terms in the question are "models" and "tested on".

    ## Step 3: Identify the relevant entities and properties in the context
    The relevant entities are "SciERC benchmark dataset" and "models", and the relevant properties are "tested on" and "has model".

    ## Step 4: Construct the SPARQL query
    The SPARQL query should select the models that have been tested on the SciERC benchmark dataset. The query should filter the results to only include models that have been tested on the dataset and have a specific resource (the SciERC benchmark dataset) associated with them.

    ## Step 5: Write the SPARQL query
    ```sparql
    SELECT?model?resource
    WHERE {
     ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?resource.
      FILTER (bif:contains(str(?resource), "orkgr:R147244") && bif:contains(str(?resource), "orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION") && bif:contains(str(?resource), "orkgp:HAS_MODEL"))
    }
    ```
    Note that the actual prefix declarations and the query output might vary based on the actual data in the ORKG.

The final answer is: 
```sparql
SELECT?model?resource
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?resource.
  FILTER (bif:contains(str(?resource), "orkgr:R147244") && bif:contains(str(?resource), "orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION") && bif:contains(str(?resource), "orkgp:HAS_MODEL"))
}
