Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Concept Mention Extraction model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology#>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/predicate#>
SELECT?paper?code_reference
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgr:has_code_reference?code_reference.
 ?paper orkgr:uses_model orkgr:Concept_Mention_Extraction_model.
 ?paper orkgp:has_benchmarking_purpose?benchmarking_purpose.
}
```sparql
    Note that the SPARQL query is based on the provided context and the extracted terms and candidates. The query is designed to retrieve code references in papers that have used the Concept Mention Extraction model for benchmarking purposes. The query uses the provided URIs and types to query the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    The query first filters papers that have used the Concept Mention Extraction model (orkgr:uses_model orkgr:Concept_Mention_Extraction_model) and have benchmarking purposes (orkgp:has_benchmarking_purpose?benchmarking_purpose). Then, it retrieves the code references (orkgr:has_code_reference?code_reference) for these papers. 

    The query assumes that the papers have a URI that can be used to query the ORKG RDF data dump. The code references are assumed to be of type Information Resource (orkgc:Resource). 

    The query can be executed on the ORKG RDF data dump to retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 

    Please note that the query is based on the provided context and the extracted terms and candidates. The query may need to be adjusted or refined to accommodate additional information or changes in the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    The query is designed to be executed on a SPARQL endpoint or a SPARQL query engine. The query can be executed using a SPARQL client or a SPARQL query tool. 

    The query returns the code references and the papers that have used the Concept Mention Extraction model for benchmarking purposes. The query can be used to retrieve the correct answer to the input question.
