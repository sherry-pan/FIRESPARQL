Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the Automatically labeled Medline abstracts corpus dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
           FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Automatically labeled Medline abstracts corpus dataset")
          ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
          ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
          ?eval          orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION     ?cont.
          ?model        orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?cont.
          ?model_lbl    rdfs:label               ?model_lbl.
     }   

    Note: The answer to the question "What are the models that have been benchmarked on the Automatically labeled Medline abstracts corpus dataset?" is:
    |?model      |?model_lbl         |
    |------------|---------------------|
    | Model A    | Model A              |
    | Model B    | Model B              |
   ...         |...                 |
    This answer is based on the provided SPARQL query. The query is based on the provided context information. The query retrieves the models that have been benchmarked on the specified dataset, as indicated by the "benchmarked on" relation. The "benchmarked on" relation is linked to the "has evaluation" relation, which is linked to the "has dataset" relation, which is linked to the dataset. The models are retrieved by traversing the "has model" relation from the "has evaluation" relation. The labels of the models are retrieved using the "rdfs:label" property. 

    The answer is a list of models that have been benchmarked on the specified dataset. The models are represented by their labels, which are the values of the "rdfs:label" property. 

    The query is based on the provided context information, which includes the entities and properties mentioned in the question, as well as candidate entities and properties in the ORKG. The query uses the following properties and relations:
    - orkgp:HAS_DATASET
    - orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK
    - orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION
    - orkgp:HAS_MODEL
    - rdfs:label
    - orkgc:Dataset
    - orkgp:Predicate
    The query retrieves the models that have been benchmarked on the specified dataset, which is represented by the "has dataset" relation. The models are retrieved by traversing the "has model" relation from the "has evaluation" relation. The labels of the models are retrieved using the "rdfs:label" property. 

    The query is a simple traversal
