Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the MNIST dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?dataset 
    WHERE {
     ?dataset orkg:hasDataset?model.
     ?dataset orkg:hasDataset?dataset.
     ?model orkg:hasModel?model.
     ?model orkg:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
      FILTER (?evaluation orkg:hasDataset "orkgr:R122690")
    } 

    Note: The ORKG does not provide the actual graph data. The provided data is used to generate the query. The actual graph data is assumed to be available.
    The query is generated based on the provided context and the input question. The query is designed to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question.
    The query is a valid SPARQL query, but it may need to be optimized or refined based on the actual graph data. 

    The query works as follows:
    1. It first identifies the models that have been benchmarked on the MNIST dataset.
    2. Then, it filters the results to only include the models that have been benchmarked on the MNIST dataset.
    The query uses the following predicates:
    - orkg:hasDataset
    - orkg:hasModel
    - orkg:hasEvaluation
    The query also uses the following filter:
    -?evaluation orkg:hasDataset "orkgr:R122690"
    This filter ensures that only models that have been benchmarked on the MNIST dataset are included in the results. 

    Please note that this is a generated query based on the provided context and the input question. The actual graph data is assumed to be available. The query may need to be optimized or refined based on the actual graph data. 

    Note: The provided context includes the following information:
    - The MNIST dataset is represented as a resource with URI "orkgr:R122690".
    - The concept of models is represented by the predicate orkg:hasModel.
    - The concept of benchmarking is represented by the predicate orkg:hasEvaluation.
    - The concept of benchmarking on a dataset is represented by the predicate orkg:hasDataset. 

    This information is used to generate the SPARQL query that retrieves the models that have been benchmarked on the MNIST dataset.
