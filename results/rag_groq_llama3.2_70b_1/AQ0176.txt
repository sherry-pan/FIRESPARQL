To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined:

1. **Extract entities and properties from the question**: The question is "What models are being evaluated on the UrbanSound8k dataset?" The key entities and properties we can extract are "models" and "UrbanSound8k dataset".

2. **Retrieve similar entities or properties from the RDF data dump**: Since the provided RDF data dump does not directly mention "UrbanSound8k dataset" or specific models being evaluated on it, we'll have to look for entities or properties that could be related to the evaluation of models on datasets. However, given the data, we can look for entities labeled as "Contribution" or "Resource" that might be related to model evaluations or datasets.

3. **Calculate cosine similarity scores**: Without specific vector representations of the entities or properties in the question and those in the RDF data dump, we'll simplify this step by looking for entities or properties that have labels containing keywords from the question, such as "model", "evaluation", "dataset", etc.

Given the constraints and the data provided, here's a simplified approach to find similar entities or properties:

- **Entities/Properties of Interest**:
  - R76244 (Team 2 Subtask 1 English) - Could be related to evaluations or tasks.
  - R75430 (IBM Journal of Research and Development) - A venue, potentially publishing model evaluations.
  - R75431 (Contribution 1) - A contribution, could be related to model evaluations.
  - R36054 (Contribution 1) - Another contribution, potentially related to model evaluations.
  - R44252 (BioBERT achieved the highest F1 scores) - Directly mentions a model (BioBERT) and its performance.

- **Similarity Scores**: Without actual vector representations, we assign scores based on relevance:
  - R44252: High relevance because it mentions a model and its performance.
  - R76244, R75431, R36054: Moderate relevance as they could be related to evaluations or contributions in the field of model development.
  - R75430: Lower relevance as it's a venue, but could still be related to publications about model evaluations.

**Output**:

```json
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R44252",
    "label": "BioBERT achieved the highest F1 scores",
    "score": 0.8
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R76244",

    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R75431",
    "label": "Contribution 1",
    "score": 0.4
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36054",
    "label": "Contribution 1",
    "score": 0.4
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R75430",
    "label": "IBM Journal of Research and Development",
    "score": 0.2
  }
]
```

Note: The scores are hypothetical and based on a simplified interpretation of relevance. Actual cosine similarity scores would require vector representations of the question and the entities/properties, typically derived from embeddings like Word2Vec, GloVe, or BERT.
