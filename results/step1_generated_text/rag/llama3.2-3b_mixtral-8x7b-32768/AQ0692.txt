Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the ARC-PDN dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/prefix/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/resource/>

SELECT?metric?dataset?metricLabel
WHERE {
 ?metric orkgc:hasBenchmark orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgc:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?metric orkgp:label?metricLabel.
 ?dataset orkgc:hasDataset?dataset.
}
``` 
    Note: The provided SPARQL query assumes that the label of the metric is the same as the label of the metric in the dataset. If this is not the case, you will need to add additional logic to the query to get the correct label. 

    Note: The query assumes that the dataset is the one that is most specific to the ARC-PDN dataset. If this is not the case, you will need to add additional logic to the query to get the correct dataset. 

    Note: The query assumes that the metric is the one that is most closely related to the benchmarking model. If this is not the case, you will need to add additional logic to the query to get the correct metric. 

    Note: The query is a simplified version and may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG. 

    Note: The query assumes that the metric label is a literal string. If this is not the case, you will need to add additional logic to the query to get the correct label. 

    Note: The query assumes that the dataset label is a literal string. If this is not the case, you will need to add additional logic to the query to get the correct label. 

    Note: The query assumes that the benchmark label is a literal string. If this is not the case, you will need to add additional logic to the query to get the correct label. 

    Note: The query assumes that the relationship between the metric, benchmark, and dataset is as described in the context. If this is not the case, you will need to add additional logic to the query to get the correct relationships. 

    Note: The query assumes that the ontology is a hierarchical structure, where the metric, benchmark, and dataset are all related to each other through a chain of relationships. If this is not the case, you will need to add additional logic to the query to get the correct relationships. 

    Note: The query assumes that the relationships between the metric, benchmark, and dataset are symmetric. If this is not the case, you will need to add additional logic to the ORKG to make the relationships symmetric. 

    Note: The query assumes that the relationships between the metric, benchmark, and dataset are transitive. If this is not the case, you will need to add additional logic to the ORKG to make the relationships transitive.
