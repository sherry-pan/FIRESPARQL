Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Atari 2600 Up and Down dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp#>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr#>

SELECT?metric?dataset
WHERE {
 ?metric orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION_METRIC?metricLabel.
 ?metric orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model.
 ?model orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgr:R122689.
 ?metric orkgr:R122689.
}
``` 
    Note: The provided SPARQL query is not the only possible query that could be generated from the given input question and context. There may be other valid SPARQL queries that could also be generated. 

    Note: The URIs in the provided SPARQL query are fictional and for demonstration purposes only. You would need to replace them with the actual URIs from the ORKG.

    Note: The SPARQL query assumes that the "HAS_EVALUATION_METRIC", "HAS_MODEL", "HAS_BENCHMARK", "R122689" properties are defined in the ORKG and that the "Evaluation Metric", "Model", "Benchmark" labels are defined in the ORKG. 

    Note: The SPARQL query uses the "RDF Type" property to link the "Evaluation Metric", "Model", and "Benchmark" resources to their respective classes in the ORKG.
