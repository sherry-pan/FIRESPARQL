Question:
List the code links in papers that use the linear-chain CRFs model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?code_link
WHERE {
 ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
            rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "linear-chain CRFs")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:P31               ?paper.
 ?paper          orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
 ?paper          orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code_link.
}
``` 
    Note: The above code snippet is a direct translation of the provided explanation into a SPARQL query. It is based on the provided context and the query provided in the prompt. 

    This SPARQL query retrieves code links in papers that use the linear-chain CRFs model in any benchmark. The query first filters papers that use the linear-chain CRFs model, then retrieves the code links in those papers. 

    The query uses the `orkgp:HAS_DATASET`, `orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK`, `orkgp:P31`, `orkgp:HAS_MODEL`, and `orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE` properties to link papers to datasets, benchmarks, papers, models, and code links, respectively. 

    The `FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "linear-chain CRFs")` clause filters the model labels to only include "linear-chain CRFs". 

    The `?code_link` variable is selected to return the code links in the papers that use the linear-chain CRFs model. 

    The query assumes that the RDF data is stored in an ORKG repository and that the properties and classes are correctly defined. 

    The query can be executed using an ORKG-compatible SPARQL engine to retrieve the code links in papers that use the linear-chain CRFs model. 

    The query can be modified to retrieve different information or to filter the results based on additional criteria. 

    The query can also be combined with other queries to retrieve more complex information.
