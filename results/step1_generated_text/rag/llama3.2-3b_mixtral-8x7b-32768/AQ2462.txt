Question:
Can you list benchmarked problems in the area of Artificial Intelligence?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/orkgc/>

SELECT?problem?fieldOfStudy 
WHERE {
 ?problem orkgp:hasBenchmark?b.
 ?b orkgp:benchmarkedAgainst?f.
 ?f orkgc:hasFieldOfStudy?fieldOfStudy.
 ?problem orkgc:relatedTo?fieldOfStudy.
 ?problem orkgp:hasEvaluation?e.
 ?e orkgc:relatedTo?fieldOfStudy.
 ?fieldOfStudy orkgc:relatedTo?problem.
  FILTER (STR(?f) = "Artificial Intelligence").
}
``` 
    Note: The provided SPARQL query might not be optimal or efficient. It is generated based on the provided input question and context. 
    The query is designed to find the benchmarked problems in the area of Artificial Intelligence, but it may not be the most efficient way to do so. 

    If you want to generate a more efficient SPARQL query, you can try to use more specific filters or join tables more effectively. 

    However, this is a task that requires a good understanding of the provided context and the structure of the ORKG. 

    You can use the provided context to filter the results more effectively, for example, by using the `FILTER` clause to filter out problems that are not benchmarked against Artificial Intelligence. 

    Also, you can try to use the `FILTER` clause to filter out problems that do not have any evaluations. 

    The `FILTER` clause can be used to filter the results based on the values of the variables. For example, you can use `FILTER (STR(?f) = "Artificial Intelligence")` to filter out problems that are not benchmarked against Artificial Intelligence. 

    You can also use `FILTER (STR(?e) = "evaluation")` to filter out problems that do not have any evaluations. 

    The `FILTER` clause can be used to filter the results based on the values of the variables. For example, you can use `FILTER (STR(?f) = "Artificial Intelligence")` to filter out problems that are not benchmarked against Artificial Intelligence. 

    You can also use `FILTER (STR(?
