Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The query is asking for a list of papers that used the BERT + BiLSTM + CRF Decoding model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of the model or related terms. The context includes several RDF triples. I see that in the first file, there's a step that mentions using a CRF algorithm. Specifically, Step 4 says they applied a NER approach using a CRF algorithm. That's a part of the model the user is asking about.

Looking further, I see that the context includes information about papers. For example, R147246 has authors like Ligia Sierra and others, published in 2015. Another paper, R283710, was published in 2021 with authors Yuanyuan Wu and others. These papers are part of the ORKG data and might be relevant.

I need to extract the terms from the question. The key entities are "papers" and the specific model "BERT + BiLSTM + CRF Decoding". The properties would be "utilized" and "links to their code". 

Next, I'll search the context for these terms. The model isn't explicitly mentioned, but the CRF part is in Step 4. The papers mentioned in the context could be candidates. 

I'll list the papers found in the context. R147246 is from 2015 with multiple authors, and R283710 is from 2021 with different authors. These are the top candidates since they are the only papers mentioned.

I should structure the answer in JSON, grouping by the extracted terms. Each term will have a list of candidates with their URIs, labels, and types. 

I also need to ensure that the URIs use the correct prefixes like orkgr: for resources and orkgp: for properties. Since the model isn't explicitly in the context, I'll note that no specific model was found but include the papers that used related techniques.

Finally, I'll format the JSON, making sure each candidate has the necessary details and that the structure matches the example provided.
