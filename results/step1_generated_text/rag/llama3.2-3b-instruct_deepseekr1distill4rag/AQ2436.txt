Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the ImageNet + iNat on WS-DAN model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?s?p?o 
WHERE {
 ?s?p?o.
  FILTER (REGEX (STR(?s), "ImageNet") || 
           REGEX (STR(?s), "iNat") || 
           REGEX (STR(?s), "WS-DAN") || 
           REGEX (STR(?o), "code") || 
           REGEX (STR(?o), "benchmark") || 
           REGEX (STR(?o), "provide links"))
}
