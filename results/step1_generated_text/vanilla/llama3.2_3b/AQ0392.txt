Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/orkg/>
     PREFIX vocab: <http://purl.org/vocab/ontology-in-owl#>
     SELECT?title?id WHERE {
   ?paper a orkg:ResearchPaper.
   ?paper vocab:hasBenchmarkModel?benchmarkModel.
   ?benchmarkModel vocab:hasDataset?dataset.
   ?dataset vocab:hasDatasetName "Penn Treebank".
   ?paper vocab:hasTitle?title.
   ?paper orkg:paperId?id.
    FILTER (str(?dataset) = "Penn Treebank" AND str(?benchmarkModel)!= "")
    }
    } 
    Note: str() function is used to convert the string to a literal in SPARQL, to avoid errors. 
    Also, the question asks for titles and IDs, so we filter for papers that have a non-empty benchmark model. 
    Please let me know if this is correct or not. 
    If it's not correct, I would like to know what's missing or incorrect. 

    Thank you for your time and assistance.
