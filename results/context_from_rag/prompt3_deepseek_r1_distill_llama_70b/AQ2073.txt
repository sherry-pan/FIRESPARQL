Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's question using the provided context. The question is asking where to find code references in papers that used the BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo model for benchmarking. 

First, I'll break down the question to extract the key terms. The main entities here are "code references," "papers," and the specific model "BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo." The action is "used for benchmarking purposes."

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates related to papers, models, and benchmarking. For example, R147652 describes a method involving steps like using seed terms, expanding them with TSE, and applying NER with CRF. R283709 and R283710 are about papers with various authors and publication details.

I need to find entities and properties related to code references, papers, and the model. From the context, I can see that "code references" might relate to "public deliverables" or "keyphrase extraction." "Papers" are mentioned as resources with authors and venues. The model isn't explicitly named, but terms like "method" and "solution proposal" might be relevant.

Next, I'll map these extracted terms to the context. "Code references" could be linked to "public deliverables" or "keyphrase extraction." "Papers" are resources like R147246 and R283710. The model isn't directly mentioned, so I'll look for related terms like "method" or "solution proposal."

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their candidates. Each term will have up to five candidates from the context, using the appropriate RDF prefixes. I'll make sure to include URIs, labels, and types correctly.

Finally, I'll ensure the JSON follows the specified format, grouping results by extracted terms and including all necessary details like URIs and types. I'll avoid using prior knowledge and stick strictly to the provided context.
