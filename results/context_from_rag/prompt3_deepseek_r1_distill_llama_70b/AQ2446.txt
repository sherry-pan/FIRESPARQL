Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the Shake-Shake (SAM) model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of the Shake-Shake model or SAM model. Scanning through the triples, I see resources like R147246 and R283710, which are papers with authors and publication details. However, I don't see any direct mention of the Shake-Shake model in these entries. 

Next, I'll check if there are any related models or datasets connected to these papers. The context talks about methods like SVM and MNIST, but not Shake-Shake. It also discusses NER approaches and CRF algorithms, which are different from what the user is asking for.

Since the context doesn't provide information about the Shake-Shake model or any papers using it, I can't extract any relevant terms or candidates from the given data. Therefore, the extracted terms would be empty, and there are no candidates to list.

I should structure the JSON response to reflect this, ensuring that the extracted terms and candidates sections are accurate based on the context provided.

```json
{
  "question": "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Shake-Shake (SAM) model and include the links to their code?",
  "extracted_terms": {
    "Shake-Shake (SAM) model": "",
    "papers": "",
    "links to their code": ""
  },
  "candidates": {
    "Shake-Shake (SAM) model": [],
    "papers": [],
    "links to their code": []
  }
}
```
