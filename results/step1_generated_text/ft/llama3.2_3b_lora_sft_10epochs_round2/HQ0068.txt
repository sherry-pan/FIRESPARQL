 SELECT?sector?sector_label 
     WHERE {
        ?contrib?sector orkgp:P32?sector_labels.
         FILTER(REGEX(?sector_labels, "energy", "i"))
        ?sector_labels rdfs:label?sector_label.
     }
     GROUP BY?sector_label
     HAVING (COUNT(?sector) > 1)
     ORDER BY COUNT(?sector) DESC<|eot_id|>
