Question:
Which sectors are modeled as energy sectors and how often?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?sector?sector_labels (COUNT(?frequency) AS?frequency)
     WHERE {
       orkgr:R153801 orkgp:compareContribution?contrib.
      ?contrib orkgp:P43135?sector.
      ?sector rdfs:label?sector_labels.
      ?contrib orkgp:P43134?energy.
      ?energy orkgp:P43133?frequency.
       FILTER(REGEX(?sector_labels, "energy"))
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(?frequency)<|eot_id|>
