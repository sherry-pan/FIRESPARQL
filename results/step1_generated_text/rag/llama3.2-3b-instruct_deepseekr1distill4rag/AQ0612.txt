Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the Atari 2600 Defender dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:includesBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:dataset?dataset.
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset ora:datasetURI?uri.
 ?benchmark ora:benchmarkFor?benchmarkFor.
 ?benchmarkFor ora:dataset?datasetFor.
 ?datasetFor a ora:Dataset.
 ?datasetFor ora:datasetURI?uriFor.
 ?paper ora:title?title.
 ?paper ora:id?id.
  FILTER (?datasetURI = "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075").
  FILTER (?benchmarkFor = "Atari 2600 Defender dataset").

    Note that the above SPARQL query is based on the provided context data and the input question. The actual query might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure and data of the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). 

    Also, note that the SPARQL query is a simplified version of what might be needed to answer the question. Depending on the actual structure of the ORKG, additional filters, joins, or aggregations might be required. 

    The provided SPARQL query is based on the following assumptions:

    *   The `ora:ResearchPaper` class represents research papers.
    *   The `ora:includesBenchmark` property indicates that a research paper includes a benchmark.
    *   The `ora:dataset` property represents a dataset.
    *   The `ora:datasetURI` property provides the URI of a dataset.
    *   The `ora:benchmarkFor` property indicates that a benchmark is for a specific dataset.
    *   The `ora:dataset` property represents a dataset.
    *   The `ora:datasetURI` property provides the URI of a dataset.
    *   The `ora:title` property provides the title of a research paper.
    *   The `ora:id` property provides the ID of a research paper.

    The SPARQL query uses the `FILTER` construct to narrow down the results to papers that include a benchmark for the Atari 2600 Defender dataset and have a specific dataset URI. The `FILTER` construct is used to match the dataset URI with the specified value. 

    The `ora:benchmarkFor` property is used to match the benchmark with the specific dataset. 

    The `ora:title` and `ora:id` properties are used to retrieve the title and ID of the research paper. 

    The `FILTER` construct is used to narrow down the results to papers that match the specified criteria.
