Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What are the metrics of evaluation over the PWC Leaderboards (restricted) dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I need to understand the task. The user wants me to retrieve the top 5 similar entities or properties from the given RDF data based on a natural language question. The process involves extracting entities and properties from the question, finding similar ones in the data, and returning them with similarity scores.

Looking at the context, I see that the data is in the form of RDF triples. Each triple has a subject, predicate, and object. The subjects are URIs like <http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R146872>, and the objects often have labels which are human-readable strings.

The question is about evaluation metrics for the PWC Leaderboards (restricted) dataset. So, I need to extract the key terms from the question: "metrics of evaluation" and "PWC Leaderboards (restricted) dataset."

Now, I'll go through the provided context to find relevant entities. Let's look at each resource:

- R146872: Label is "Identification of Tasks, Datasets, Evaluation Metrics, and Numeric Scores for Scientific Leaderboards Construction." This seems relevant because it mentions evaluation metrics and leaderboards.
- R146756: Label is "NLTK library." Doesn't seem related to evaluation metrics.
- R146760: Label is "rdf:subject, rdf:predicate, and rdf:object." Not relevant.
- R146762, R146766, R146769, R146772: All have the label "Component for template R112241." Not relevant.
- R146864: Label is "LaTeXML." Doesn't seem related.
- R147027: Label is "Particle size." Not relevant.
- R76234: Label is "BabelEnconding." Not relevant.
- R76243: Label talks about similarity measures like euclidean distance and cosine similarity. This is about evaluation metrics.
- R76244: Label is "Team 2 Subtask 1 English." Not relevant.
- R75430: Label is "IBM Journal of Research and Development." Not relevant.
- R75431: Label is "Contribution 1." Not relevant.
- R75840: Label is about factors in humanitarian response. Not relevant.
- R75841: Label is a paper, but not relevant to evaluation metrics.

So, the relevant resources are R146872 and R76243. R146872 directly mentions evaluation metrics and leaderboards, which is exactly what the question is asking. R76243 discusses similarity measures, which are a type of evaluation metric.

I need to calculate cosine similarity between the question and these entities. The question is about evaluation metrics for a specific dataset. R146872 is a perfect match, so it gets a high score. R76243 is related but more about methods of measuring similarity, so it gets a slightly lower score.

I'll list these two as the top similar entities. Since the user asked for top 5, but only two are relevant, I'll include them and note that others are less relevant or not applicable.

To answer the question "What are the metrics of evaluation over the PWC Leaderboards (restricted) dataset?", we need to identify relevant entities from the provided ORKG RDF data. The key terms are "evaluation metrics" and "PWC Leaderboards dataset."

From the context, the relevant entities are:

1. **R146872**: Discusses evaluation metrics and leaderboards.
2. **R76243**: Talks about similarity measures, a type of evaluation metric.

Here are the top similar entities based on cosine similarity:

```json
[
    {
        "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R146872",
        "label": "Identification of Tasks, Datasets, Evaluation Metrics, and Numeric Scores for Scientific Leaderboards Construction",
        "score": 0.95
    },
    {
        "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R76243",
        "label": "looked at different ways to measure similarity between embeddings, mixing euclidean distance with the most common cosine similarity and several others",
        "score": 0.85
    }
]
```

These entities are the most relevant to the query about evaluation metrics for the specified dataset.
