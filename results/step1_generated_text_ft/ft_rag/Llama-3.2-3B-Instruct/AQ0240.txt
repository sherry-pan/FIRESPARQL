Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the Atari 2600 Ms. Pacman dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?model
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Ms. Pacman")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                  orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?eval,
                orkgpHAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?contribution orkgp:P31               ?paper,
                rdfs:label              ?model.
}
```      ``` 
    If you want to make the code more efficient, you could use the `orkgp:HAS_DATASET` and `orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION` properties to filter the results in a single query, instead of using a filter to check the label of the dataset. This would also make the query more readable and maintainable. 

    ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?model
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Ms. Pacman")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                  orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?eval,
                orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?contribution orkgp:P31               ?paper,
                rdfs:label              ?model.
}
```      ``` 
    This query will return the models that have been evaluated on the Atari 2600 Ms. Pacman dataset. However, please note that the provided RDF data does not contain any entities or properties related to the Atari 2600 Ms. Pacman dataset or models evaluated on it. Therefore, no similar entities can be retrieved. 

    ```json
[]
```      ``` 
    In this case, the output will be an empty list, indicating that there are no similar entities to retrieve. 

    ```json
[]
```      ``` 
    This output is a JSON array containing an empty list, indicating that there are no similar entities to retrieve.
