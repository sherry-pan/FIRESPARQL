Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Yelp Fine-grained classification dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    SELECT?metric?metricLabel
    WHERE {
       ?yelpDataset orkgr:hasDataset?dataset.
       ?dataset orkgc:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
       ?evaluation orkgc:hasMetric?metric.
       ?metric orkgc:hasLabel?metricLabel.
        FILTER (str(?metricLabel) = "Accuracy" OR str(?metricLabel) = "F1 Score" OR str(?metricLabel) = "Precision" OR str(?metricLabel) = "Recall" OR str(?metricLabel) = "Area Under ROC Curve (AUC-ROC)")
    }
    ```
    Note: The ORKG is fictional and the entities and properties used in the query are fictional as well. This query is only a solution for the given question and may not work with the actual ORKG.
    ``` 
    Note: You are expected to write the query in SPARQL query syntax, and you can use any SPARQL query syntax features available to you. You are also expected to use the entities and properties provided in the context to construct the query.
    You can assume that the SPARQL endpoint is available at the URL "http://example.org/sparql".
    You can also assume that the query will be executed with the correct credentials.
    You should only output the SPARQL query, without any additional comments or explanations.
    ```
    ```sparql
    ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    SELECT?metric?metric
