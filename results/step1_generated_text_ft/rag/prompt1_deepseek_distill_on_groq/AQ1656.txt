Okay, so I need to figure out the best performing model for benchmarking the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset in terms of FLOPS. Let me start by looking at the context information provided.

First, I see that there are several resources related to the Oxford-IIIT Pets benchmark. For example, resource R134560 is labeled "Benchmark Oxford-IIIT Pets". Then, there are evaluations like R134561 and R134562, which have accuracy and top error rates. R134563 is a contribution called "Contribution BiT-S (ResNet)". 

Looking further, I notice another section where resource R135103 is also "Benchmark Oxford-IIIT Pets". There's an evaluation R135104 with a very high accuracy of 99.91, and a contribution R135105 labeled "Contribution BiLsm-TDN". 

I'm trying to find the best performing model, so I should focus on the evaluations and contributions associated with the Oxford-IIIT Pets benchmark. The higher the accuracy, the better the performance. R135104 has an accuracy of 99.91%, which is much higher than R134561's 94.47%. 

The contributions linked to these benchmarks are BiT-S (ResNet) and BiLsm-TDN. Since R135104 has a higher accuracy, the associated contribution is likely the better performing model. Therefore, the best performing model is probably "Contribution BiLsm-TDN" with an accuracy of 99.91%.

To determine the best performing model for benchmarking the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset in terms of FLOPS, we analyze the provided context. The dataset is associated with high accuracy evaluations, particularly 99.91%, linked to the contribution "Contribution BiLsm-TDN". This suggests that the model "BiLsm-TDN" achieves superior performance on the Oxford-IIIT Pets benchmark.
