Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the provided JSON file are most relevant to the question: "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the AxCell model for benchmarking purposes?" 

First, I'll break down the question. The user is looking for code references in papers, specifically those that used AxCell for benchmarking. So, the key elements here are "code references," "papers," "AxCell model," and "benchmarking."

Looking at the JSON properties, I need to find terms that relate to code, benchmarking, papers, and possibly the model or dataset usage.

1. **has benchmark**: This seems directly related because benchmarking is a key part of the question. It likely refers to papers that use benchmarks, which fits the context of using AxCell for benchmarking.

2. **implementation**: This could refer to how the model is implemented, which might include code references in papers. If a paper describes how they implemented AxCell, they might include code snippets or references.

3. **has dataset**: While this is more about data, if the dataset is used in benchmarking, it could be relevant. Papers using AxCell for benchmarking might mention the datasets they used, which could lead to code references.

4. **evaluation**: This is about assessing the model's performance, which often involves benchmarking. Papers that evaluate AxCell would likely include their methods and possibly code references.

5. **method**: This is a bit broader, but if the method section of a paper includes how they applied AxCell for benchmarking, it might point to code references.

I think these properties are the most relevant because they all touch on aspects of benchmarking, implementation, and evaluation, which are central to the question. They help narrow down where code references might be mentioned in the papers using AxCell.
