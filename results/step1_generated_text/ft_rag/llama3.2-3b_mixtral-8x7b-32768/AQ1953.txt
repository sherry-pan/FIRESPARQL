Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the CL-Titles-Parser model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?model    orkgp:HAS_MODEL            orkgp:R44243.
      ?model orkgp:UTILIZES          ?utilization.
      ?utilization orkgp:HAS_PAPER      ?paper.
      ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE          ?code.
     }
    ```
The provided SPARQL query is already optimized for the given input question and context. However, I'll provide a breakdown of the query to understand how it works.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the query:

1. `SELECT?code`: This line specifies that we want to retrieve the value of the `?code` variable.

2. `WHERE {... }`: This line begins the WHERE clause of the SPARQL query.

3. The first line, `?model    orkgp:HAS_MODEL            orkgp:R44243.`, filters the models based on the CL-Titles-Parser model (identified by the URI `orkgr:R44243`). It retrieves the model with the given URI that has a HAS_MODEL property.

4. The second line, `?model orkgp:UTILIZES          ?utilization.`, retrieves the utilization of the model obtained in the previous step. It filters the model based on the HAS_MODEL property and retrieves the utilization.

5. The third line, `?utilization orkgp:HAS_PAPER      ?paper.`, retrieves the papers that are utilized by the model obtained in the previous step. It filters the utilization based on the HAS_PAPER property and retrieves the paper.

6. The fourth line, `?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE          ?code.`, retrieves the code for the paper obtained in the previous step. It filters the paper based on the HAS_CODE property and retrieves the code.

7. The `?code` variable is then used to retrieve the value of the code.

In summary, this SPARQL query retrieves the code for papers that utilize the CL-Titles-Parser model. It follows the specified flow to achieve this:

-   It starts by finding the model with the given URI (`orkgr:R44243`) that has utilized the CL-Titles-Parser model.
-   It then retrieves the utilization of this model.
-   Next, it gets the papers that are utilized by this model.
-   Finally, it gets the code for the papers that are utilized by the CL-Titles-Parser model.

This query is optimized for the given input question and context. It effectively retrieves the required information and adheres to the specified flow
