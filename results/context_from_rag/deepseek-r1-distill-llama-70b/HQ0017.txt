Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to answer the question "What is the most common location in the studies?" using the provided JSON properties. Let me go through the properties one by one and see which ones might be relevant.

First, I see properties related to locations, like "city" (P97141 and P97144). These seem directly relevant because they mention city, which is a location. So, these could help identify where the studies were conducted.

Next, there's "country" (P97140). That's another location-based property, so it's definitely useful for determining locations in studies.

I also notice "geographical region" (P97142). This is a broader term but still related to location, so it could be helpful in identifying regions where studies are common.

Looking further, "location" (P97143) is a general term, which might be too vague, but it's still worth considering as it directly relates to the question.

I should make sure I'm not missing any other location-related properties. Scanning through the list again, I don't see any others. So, the most relevant properties are the ones mentioning city, country, geographical region, and the general location.

I think these properties will help in pinpointing the locations mentioned in the studies and determining which one is the most common.

To answer the question "What is the most common location in the studies?", the following properties from the JSON file are most relevant:

1. **City**: This property directly refers to the city locations, which are essential for identifying common locations in studies.
2. **Country**: This helps in understanding the country-level locations, which might be frequently mentioned.
3. **Geographical Region**: This broader term can help identify regions that are commonly studied.
4. **Location**: A general term that could encompass various location types, aiding in identifying common places.

These properties collectively provide the necessary data to determine the most common locations in the studies.
