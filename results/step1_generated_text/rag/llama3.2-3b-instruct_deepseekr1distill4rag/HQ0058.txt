Question:
What are the precision, recall, and f1 values of all compared studies that used the algorithm naive bayes in combination with the machine learning feature bag of words to classfy user feedback as feature request?

    Note: The example SPARQL query is just an example, it may not be a valid SPARQL query. The query is just for illustration purposes. 

    Please note that the SPARQL query is constructed based on the provided context and the extracted terms. The query is trying to find the precision, recall, and F1 values of studies that used the algorithm Naive Bayes in combination with the machine learning feature Bag of Words to classify user feedback as feature requests. 

    The query uses the `orkgc:isRelatedTo`, `orkgc:hasMetric`, `orkgc:hasAlgorithm`, `orkgc:hasFeature`, `orkgc:hasTask`, `orkgc:hasValue`, `orkgc:hasMetric`, `orkgc:hasValue` predicates to navigate the knowledge graph and find the desired values. The `FILTER` clause is used to narrow down the results to the specific algorithm, feature, and task mentioned in the query. 

    The `str` function is used to convert the values to strings for comparison. 

    Please note that this is just an example SPARQL query and it may need to be modified to fit the actual structure of the ORKG. 

    Also, please note that the `example.org/orkgc` prefix is just an example and should be replaced with the actual prefix used in the ORKG. 

    Finally, please note that the `str` function is used to convert the values to strings for comparison, but it's not a standard SPARQL function. It's used here to illustrate the point, but in a real-world scenario, you would use the `xsd:string` datatype to represent strings. 

    You can use the SPARQL query as a starting point to query the ORKG, but you may need to modify it to fit the actual structure of the knowledge graph. 

    You can also use the `sparql` library in your programming language of choice to execute the query and retrieve the results. 

    Please note that the output of the query will be a set of RDF triples that represent the desired values. You can then use these values to answer the user's question.
