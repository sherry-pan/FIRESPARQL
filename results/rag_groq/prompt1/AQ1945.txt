Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given context. The query is asking to list the code links in papers that use the H-NLI model in any benchmark. But looking at the context provided, I don't see any information about the H-NLI model or code links. The context has various resources like papers, contributions, venues, etc., but none of them mention H-NLI or benchmarks related to it. 

I should check each resource in the context to see if any are related. Let's go through them one by one. 

First, there's R76234 labeled "BabelEnconding" – doesn't seem relevant. Then R76243 talks about measuring similarity between embeddings, which is somewhat related to models but not H-NLI specifically. R76244 is "Team 2 Subtask 1 English" – not relevant. R75430 is a venue, "IBM Journal of Research and Development" – not related. R75431 is "Contribution 1" – too vague. R75840 and R75841 are about humanitarian response and a paper, respectively, but no mention of H-NLI.

Looking at the second file, R163201 is about Wikipedia-based NER. R162991 is a paper on NER in tweets, and R162992 is the venue for that paper. R162993 is another contribution. R163369 is about "Entity", and R163375 and R163376 are about "Core entity/Event". R163378 is another resource but no details. 

None of these resources mention H-NLI or code links. So, based on the context, there's no information available to answer the query. Therefore, the top similar entities would be none or not applicable.

The query seeks information about papers using the H-NLI model and their code links, but the provided context does not contain any relevant data. Therefore, no similar entities or properties can be retrieved.
