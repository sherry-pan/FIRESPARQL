Question:
What is Raman spectroscopy?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?s?p?o
     WHERE {
    ?s?p?o.
     FILTER (REGEX(\"Raman spectroscopy\", \"i\")).
     }
    Note: The regex filter is used to capture the term in the query string. However, this is not the correct answer. We want the query to filter on the correct resource URI in the ORKG. So the filter should be changed to filter on the correct URI. 
    The correct answer is:
    SELECT?s?p?o
    WHERE {
    ?s?p?o.
     FILTER (REGEX(\"Raman spectroscopy\", \"i\")).
    ?s a ora:RamanSpectroscopy.
     }
    where the filter is changed to filter on the correct resource URI. 
    The correct answer is:
    SELECT?s?p?o
    WHERE {
    ?s?p?o.
     FILTER (REGEX(\"Raman spectroscopy\", \"i\")).
    ?s ora:RamanSpectroscopy.
     }
    SELECT?s?p?o
    WHERE {
    ?s?p?o.
     FILTER (REGEX(\"Raman spectroscopy\", \"i\")).
    ?s ora:RamanSpectroscopy.
     }
    }
    Note that the correct answer is not the first one. The correct answer is the third one. The first two answers are not correct. The first answer is missing the filter to select the correct resource URI. The second answer is missing the filter to select the correct resource URI. 

    Therefore, the correct answer is the third one. 

    To determine the correct answer, we need to look at the candidates provided in the context. 
    The correct resource URI is ora:RamanSpectroscopy. 
    The correct answer is the one that filters on this correct resource URI. 
    Therefore, the correct answer is:
    SELECT?s?p?o
    WHERE {
    ?s?p?o.
     FILTER (REGEX(\"Raman spectroscopy\", \"i\")).
    ?s ora:RamanSpectroscopy.
     }
    where the filter is changed to filter on the correct resource URI. 

    The correct answer is the third one.
    ```
    SELECT?s?p?o
    WHERE {
    ?s?p?o.
     FILTER (REGEX(\"Raman spectroscopy\", \"i\")).
    ?s ora:RamanSpectroscopy.
     }
    }
    ```
