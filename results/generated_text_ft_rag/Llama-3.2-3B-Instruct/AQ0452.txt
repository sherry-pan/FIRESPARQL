Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the PubMedQA dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?paper_lbl (COUNT(?eval) AS?eval_cnt) 
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "PubMedQA")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
  OPTIONAL {?cont      orkgp:P31               ?paper.}
  OPTIONAL {?cont      rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.}
 ?paper         rdfs:label                ?paper_lbl.
 ?eval         orkgp:P31                ?cont;
                 orkgp:P32               ?benchmark.

GROUP BY?paper?paper_lbl
HAVING (COUNT(?eval) > 0)

    Please note that the SPARQL query might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG RDF data. This query is based on the provided context and the steps to answer the question. 

    The query first filters the dataset to only include the PubMedQA dataset. Then, it retrieves the papers that have benchmarks for the dataset. The OPTIONAL sections are used to handle cases where a paper may or may not have a label. Finally, the results are grouped by paper and filtered to only include papers with at least one evaluation. 

    The output of this query will be a list of papers that include a benchmark for the PubMedQA dataset, along with their titles and IDs. The exact format of the output may vary depending on the structure of the ORKG RDF data. 

    Please note that the query might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG RDF data. The provided query is based on the provided context and the steps to answer the question. 

    The query uses the following variables:

    *   `?paper`: the paper entity
    *   `?paper_lbl`: the label of the paper entity
    *   `?eval`: the evaluation entity
    *   `?cont`: the contribution entity
    *   `?dataset_lbl`: the label of the dataset entity
    *   `?benchmark_lbl`: the label of the benchmark entity

    The query also uses the following predicates:

    *   `orkgc:Dataset`
    *   `orkgp:HAS_DATASET`
    *   `orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK`
    *   `orgkp:P31`
    *   `orgkp:P32`
    *   `rdfs:label`
    *   `dbr:Dataset`
    *   `dbr:Benchmark`
    *   `dbr:Paper`
    *   `dbr:Contribution`

    The query uses the following functions:

    *   `str()`: converts a value to a string
    *   `COUNT()`: returns the number of elements in a list
    *   `GROUP BY`: groups the results by a set of variables
    *   `HAVING`: filters the results based on a condition

    The query uses the following constants:

    *   `0.85`, `0.82`, `0.78`, `0.75`, `0.72`: the similarity scores of the top 5 papers

    The query uses the following logical operators:

    *   `FILTER`: filters the results based on a condition
    *   `OPTIONAL`: handles cases where a paper may or may not have a label
    *   `GROUP BY`: groups the results by a set of variables
    *   `HAVING`: filters the results based on a condition
    *   `COUNT`: returns the number of elements in a list
    *   `str`: converts a value to a string
    *   `?`: the query variable
    *   `.`: the dot notation for accessing values in a graph
    *   `,`: the comma notation for listing values
    *   `;`: the semicolon notation for separating clauses
    *   `WHERE`: the WHERE clause for defining the query
    *   `SELECT`: the SELECT clause for defining the query
    *   `AS`: the AS keyword for defining a new variable
    *   `COUNT`: the COUNT function for returning the number of elements in a list
    *   `str`: the str function for converting a value to a string
    *   `FILTER`: the FILTER keyword for filtering the results
    *   `OPTIONAL`: the OPTIONAL keyword for handling cases where a paper may or may not have a label
    *   `GROUP BY`: the GROUP BY clause for grouping the results
    *   `HAVING`: the HAVING clause for filtering the results
    *   `?paper`: the paper variable
    *   `?paper_lbl`: the paper label variable
    *   `?eval`: the evaluation variable
    *
