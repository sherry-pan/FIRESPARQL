Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to answer the question: "Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the QNLI benchmark dataset?" using the provided JSON context. 

First, I need to understand what the question is asking. It's looking for models evaluated on the QNLI dataset. So, I should look for properties related to models, datasets, and evaluations.

Looking at the JSON, I see properties like "has dataset" which could link models to datasets. "evaluation" might contain results of models on datasets. "method" could refer to the models themselves. "implementation" might be the specific models used. "benchmark" is directly related to testing models on datasets. "approach" could describe the model's methodology. "model" is explicitly about the models. "has benchmark" ties models to specific benchmarks like QNLI.

Each of these properties seems relevant because they connect models with their evaluations on datasets. So, I'll list these properties as they can help identify the models tested on QNLI.

To answer the question about models tested on the QNLI dataset, the relevant properties from the JSON context are:

1. **has dataset**: Links models to specific datasets.
2. **evaluation**: Contains evaluation results of models.
3. **method**: Refers to the models or approaches used.
4. **implementation**: Specifies the models implemented.
5. **benchmark**: Relates to testing models on benchmarks.
6. **approach**: Describes the model's methodology.
7. **model**: Explicitly refers to the models.
8. **has benchmark**: Connects models to specific benchmarks.

These properties help identify models evaluated on the QNLI dataset.
