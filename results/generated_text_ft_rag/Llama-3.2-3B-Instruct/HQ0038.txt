Question:
What is the mean capacity of a carbon-based fuel?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?mean_capacity
     WHERE {
      ?fuel       a            orkgc:Fuel;
                  rdfs:label  ?fuel_label.
       FILTER (str(?fuel_label) = "carbon-based fuel")
      ?fuel      orkgp:HAS_CAPACITY      ?capacity.
      ?capacity orkgp:HAS_MEAN_CAPACITY    ?mean_capacity.
     } 
    Note: The above SPARQL query is not correct and will not return the expected results. The query is missing a necessary filter condition to match the exact phrase "carbon-based fuel" in the fuel label. The correct SPARQL query should include the filter condition to match the exact phrase. Here is the corrected query:
    SELECT?mean_capacity
    WHERE {
     ?fuel       a            orkgc:Fuel;
                 rdfs:label  ?fuel_label.
      FILTER (str(?fuel_label) = "carbon-based fuel")
     ?fuel      orkgp:HAS_CAPACITY      ?capacity.
     ?capacity orkgp:HAS_MEAN_CAPACITY    ?mean_capacity.
    } 

    However, this query will still not return the expected results because the filter condition is case sensitive and will only match the phrase if the fuel label is exactly "carbon-based fuel". This is not the expected behavior, as the question is asking for the mean capacity of any carbon-based fuel. To fix this, we need to use the `?|` operator to match any character (except a newline) between "carbon-based" and "fuel". Here is the corrected query:
    SELECT?mean_capacity
    WHERE {
     ?fuel       a            orkgc:Fuel;
                 rdfs:label  ?fuel_label.
      FILTER (str(?fuel_label) = "carbon-based fuel")
     ?fuel      orkgp:HAS_CAPACITY      ?capacity.
     ?capacity orkgp:HAS_MEAN_CAPACITY    ?mean_capacity.
    } 
    FILTER (str(?fuel_label) =~ "carbon-based|fuel")
    This query will return the mean capacity of any carbon-based fuel, regardless of the exact wording in the fuel label. 

    The final answer is: 
    SELECT?mean_capacity
    WHERE {
     ?fuel       a            orkgc:Fuel;
                 rdfs:label  ?fuel_label.
      FILTER (str(?fuel_label) = "carbon-based fuel")
     ?fuel      orkgp:HAS_CAPACITY      ?capacity.
     ?capacity orkgp:HAS_MEAN_CAPACITY    ?mean_capacity.
    } 
    FILTER (str(?fuel_label) =~ "carbon-based|fuel")

     ?capacity orkgp:HAS_MEAN_CAPACITY    ?mean_capacity.
    }
