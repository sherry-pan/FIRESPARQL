Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Stanford Cars dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                     rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
        FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Stanford Cars")
       ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                        orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
        SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
        WHERE {
          ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_PAPER      ?paper.
          ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?paper_lbl.
          ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.}
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Stanford Cars")
     }<|eot_id|>
