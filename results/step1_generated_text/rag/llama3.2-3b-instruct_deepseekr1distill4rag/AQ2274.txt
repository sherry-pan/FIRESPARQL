Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PEGASUS model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://orkgr.org/rdf/ontology/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://orkp.org/rdf/ontology/>
PREFIX orkc: <http://orkc.org/rdf/ontology/>

SELECT?paper?paper_uri?code_reference
WHERE {
 ?paper a orkc:Resource.
 ?paper orkp:has_benchmarked?benchmarking_purpose.
 ?benchmarking_purpose a orkp:Evaluation_Method.
 ?paper orkp:has_code_reference?code_reference.
 ?code_reference a orkp:Code_References.
  FILTER (STR(?paper_uri) = <http://orkgr.org/rdf/data/papers/PEGASUS_model_paper>)
}
``` 
    This SPARQL query will return the papers that have used the PEGASUS model for benchmarking purposes and contain code references. The results will be filtered to only include papers that have used the PEGASUS model. 

    The query uses the following variables:
    -?paper: represents a paper
    -?paper_uri: represents the URI of a paper
    -?code_reference: represents a code reference
    -?benchmarking_purpose: represents the benchmarking purpose
    -?benchmarking_purpose_uri: represents the URI of the benchmarking purpose
    -?evaluation_method: represents the evaluation method
    -?evaluation_method_uri: represents the URI of the evaluation method

    The query uses the following predicates:
    - orkp:has_benchmarked: represents the benchmarking purpose of a paper
    - orkp:has_code_reference: represents the code references of a paper
    - orkp:Code_References: represents the code references
    - orkp:Evaluation_Method: represents the evaluation method

    The query uses the following filters:
    - FILTER (STR(?paper_uri) = <http://orkgr.org/rdf/data/papers/PEGASUS_model_paper>): filters the results to only include papers that have used the PEGASUS model. 

    This query can be executed on the ORKG RDF data dump to retrieve the desired results. 

    Note: The actual SPARQL query may vary based on the actual RDF data and the specific requirements of the query. 

    This query assumes that the RDF data is structured in the following way:
    - The papers are represented as resources with the URI <http://orkgr.org/rdf/data/papers/PEGASUS_model_paper>
    - The benchmarking purposes are represented as resources with the URI <http://orkp.org/rdf/ontology/Evaluation_Method>
    - The code references are represented as resources with the URI <http://orkp.org/rdf/ontology/Code_References>
    - The papers have a property orkp:has_benchmarked that represents the benchmarking purpose
    - The papers have a property orkp:has_code_reference that represents the code references
    - The code references have a property orkp:Code_References that represents the code references

    This query can be modified to accommodate different RDF data structures and query requirements. 

    The actual query may require additional or different predicates, filters, or variables to accommodate the specific requirements of the query. 

    The query can be executed using a SPARQL query engine such as SPARQL Query Language (SPARQL) or a RDF query engine such as Jena. 

    The actual query may require additional or different RDF data structures and query requirements.
