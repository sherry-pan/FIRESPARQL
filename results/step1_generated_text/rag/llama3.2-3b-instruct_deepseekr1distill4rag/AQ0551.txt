Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Dmlab-30 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT?paper?title?id WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:hasTitle?title.
 ?paper ora:hasId?id.
 ?paper ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasURI "http://example.org/Dmlab-30_dataset".
}
```    Note: The actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual schema of the ORKG. The above query is just an example based on the provided context.<|eot_id|>
