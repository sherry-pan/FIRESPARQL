Question:
What models are being evaluated on the AESLC dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model rdfs:label?modelLabel.
 ?dataset rdfs:label?datasetLabel.
  FILTER (?datasetLabel = "MNIST").
 ?model orkgc:evaluatedOn?dataset.
  SERVICE orkgp:graph {
   ?dataset a orkgc:Dataset.
   ?model a orkgc:Model.
  }
}
```    Note: The above SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context and the question. The actual query may need to be adjusted based on the actual data in the ORKG. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve models that are being evaluated on the MNIST dataset. The query first retrieves the labels of the models and the MNIST dataset, then filters the results to only include the models that are being evaluated on the MNIST dataset. Finally, the query uses the ORKG graph service to retrieve the actual resources that match the model and dataset labels. 

    The query assumes that the models and datasets are represented as resources in the ORKG, and that the "evaluated on" property is used to link models to the datasets they are being evaluated on. The query also assumes that the ORKG graph service is available to retrieve the actual resources that match the model and dataset labels. 

    The actual query may need to be adjusted based on the actual data in the ORKG, and may require additional steps or modifications to retrieve the correct results. 

    Note that the SPARQL query is just one possible query that can be used to answer the question, and there may be other queries that can also retrieve the correct results.
