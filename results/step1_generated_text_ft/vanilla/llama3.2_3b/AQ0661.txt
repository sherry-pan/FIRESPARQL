Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the ImageNet ReaL dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX wdt: <http://www.wikidata.org/property/>
     SELECT?paperTitle?paperId 
     WHERE {
    ?paper?paperId wdt:P3010 "ImageNet ReaL dataset".
    ?paper?paperId wdt:P2421?benchmarkingModel.
    ?benchmarkingModel wdt:P31 wdt:P111.
    ?paper wdt:P3015?paperTitle.
     } GROUP BY?paperTitle?paperId HAVING ( COUNT(?paper) > 1 )
     LIMIT 1
