Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Tsetlin Machine model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P31?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P32?code.
      ?paper orkgp:P5009?eval.
       FILTER(REGEX(?eval, "benchmark with Tsetlin Machine"))
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(COUNT(?code))
     LIMIT 10<|eot_id|>
