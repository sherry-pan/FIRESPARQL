Alright, I need to figure out how to answer the query: "What models are being evaluated on the classics dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "models" and "classics dataset". "Models" refers to machine learning models, and "classics dataset" is the specific dataset we're interested in.

Next, I'll look through the RDF data to find entities related to these terms. From the context, I see mentions of SVM and MNIST in the seed terms, which are related to models and datasets. There's also a mention of CRF algorithms, which is another model.

I need to compute the similarity between the extracted terms and the entities in the RDF data. Since the classics dataset isn't explicitly mentioned, I'll look for datasets that are similar or related. The MNIST dataset is a well-known benchmark, so it's a good candidate. For models, SVM, CRF, and SciBERT are all relevant and have high similarity scores based on their descriptions and usage.

Now, I'll structure the results, grouping them by the extracted terms. Each entry should include the URI, label, score, type, and RDF type. I'll make sure to use the correct prefixes for URIs and include the necessary details for each candidate.

Finally, I'll format the JSON output as specified, ensuring that the labels are under "rdfs:label" and the types are correctly assigned. This will allow for further processing, like generating SPARQL queries if needed.
