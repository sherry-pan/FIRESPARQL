Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the query: "List the code links in papers that use the Duel noop model in any benchmark?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by understanding the query. The user is asking for code links from papers that use the Duel noop model in any benchmark. So, the key terms here are "code links," "papers," "Duel noop model," and "benchmark."

Looking at the context information, I see that there are two main resources mentioned: R147246 and R284317. Both seem to be papers or research works with various properties. 

For R147246, the relevant properties include authors, the year (2015), and some other details. The authors listed are Ligia Sierra, Betty L LÃ³pez, Flavio Forni, Maria Angela Vandelli, Michele Zoli, and Antonietta Vilella. There's also a mention of a venue, but I'm not sure which one exactly. The value 93.9 is associated with HAS_VALUE, which might be some metric or score.

For R284317, the properties include the title "validation research," the technique used, which is "Journal Article," and it's published in 2021. The authors here are Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta. There's a URL provided: "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075" and a DOI "10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075." This seems like a code link or a reference to where the paper can be found.

Now, the Duel noop model isn't explicitly mentioned in the context. I'm not seeing any direct references to it, so maybe it's not present in the provided data. However, the user is asking about papers that use this model in any benchmark. Since the model isn't in the data, I might have to infer or look for related information.

Looking at the papers, R284317 has a URL and DOI, which could be code links. The paper is about validation research, which might involve benchmarks. So, even though the Duel noop model isn't mentioned, this paper might be relevant if it discusses models or benchmarks related to the Duel noop.

I should extract the terms from the query. The key entities are "code links," "papers," "Duel noop model," and "benchmark." The properties would be the relationships between these entities, like "uses," "is evaluated on," etc.

Next, I need to compute similarity scores. Since the Duel noop model isn't present, I'll focus on the papers that have code links and are related to benchmarks. R284317 fits because it has a URL and DOI, which are code links, and it's a journal article that might involve benchmarks.

So, the top candidates would be the papers that have code links and are related to benchmarks. Since only R284317 has a clear code link, it would be the top candidate. There might not be enough data for other candidates, so I'll include it as the main one.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON output as per the example, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including the scores based on relevance.
