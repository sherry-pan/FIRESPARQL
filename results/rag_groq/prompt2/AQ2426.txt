Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The query is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the DY-MobileNetV3-Small model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context data to see if there's any mention of the DY-MobileNetV3-Small model. Scanning the context, I see that the model isn't directly mentioned. The context includes information about other models like SVM and mentions of datasets like MNIST, but DY-MobileNetV3-Small isn't there.

Next, I check if there are any papers or resources that might be related. The context includes two papers: one from 2015 with authors Ligia Sierra, Betty L LÃ³pez, Flavio Forni, Maria Angela Vandelli, Michele Zoli, and Antonietta Vilella, and another from 2021 by Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta. Neither of these papers mentions DY-MobileNetV3-Small.

Since the model isn't present in the context, I can't extract any relevant papers or code links from the provided data. Therefore, the answer should indicate that there's no information available based on the given context.

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the DY-MobileNetV3-Small model or any associated papers and code links. The context does not mention this specific model or related resources.
