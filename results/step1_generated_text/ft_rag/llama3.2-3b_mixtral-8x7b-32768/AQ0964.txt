Question:
List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Atari 2600 Battle Zone benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric?metric_lbl
     WHERE {
       orkgp:R131168 orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK.
       orkgp:R131168 orkgp:HAS_DATASET.
       orkgp:R131168 orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
      ?metric orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION_METRIC?eval.
      ?eval orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?evalu.
      ?evalu orkgp:HAS_MODEL_EVALUATION?model.
      ?model orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION_METRIC?metric.
      ?metric rdfs:label?metric_lbl.
       } 

    If there is no answer to the question (i.e., there are no metrics used to evaluate models on the Atari 2600 Battle Zone benchmark dataset), the query will return an empty result set. The answer to the question is not a single value but a set of metrics. The answer set may contain duplicate values. The query should return all the metrics used to evaluate models on the Atari 2600 Battle Zone benchmark dataset. 

    The provided context information includes the following entities and properties:
    - orkgp:R131168 (the dataset)
    - orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK (the property for the dataset to have a benchmark)

    - orkgp:HAS_METRIC (the property for a resource to have a metric)
    - orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION_METRIC (the property for an evaluation metric)
    - orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION (the property for a metric to have an evaluation)
    - orkgp:HAS_MODEL_EVALUATION (the property for an evaluation to have a model evaluation)
    - orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION_METRIC (the property for an evaluation to have a metric)
    - rdfs:label (the property for a resource to have a label)
    - orkgp:R131168 (the dataset)
    - orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION_METRIC?metric.
    - orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?eval.
