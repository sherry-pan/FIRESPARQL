Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Sequential CIFAR-10 dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities are "evaluation metrics" and "Sequential CIFAR-10 dataset". The property here is "benchmarking models on".

Looking through the context, I see that there are steps related to model evaluation, like using a CRF algorithm and ensuring data quality. There's also information about papers, such as one from 2015 with authors Ligia Sierra, Betty L LÃ³pez, Flavio Forni, Maria Angela Vandelli, Michele Zoli, and Antonietta Vilella. Another paper from 2021 by Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta discusses validation research and techniques, which might relate to evaluation metrics.

I notice that the context includes metrics like F1-score and accuracy, which are common evaluation metrics. The paper from 2015 has a value of 93.9, which could be an accuracy score. The 2021 paper mentions validation research, which likely involves evaluation metrics.

So, the evaluation metrics mentioned are F1-score and accuracy. The dataset in question is Sequential CIFAR-10, but in the context, there's a mention of the MNIST dataset, which is similar. The benchmarking involves models like SVM, which is mentioned in the steps.

Putting it all together, the evaluation metrics are F1-score and accuracy, and the dataset is Sequential CIFAR-10. The benchmarking process involves these metrics to assess model performance.
