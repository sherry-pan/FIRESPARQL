Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the SciERC dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT?paper?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper orkc:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgc:hasDataset?dataset.
  FILTER (?dataset = <http://example.org/orkgr/SciERC_dataset>).
 ?paper orkg:hasTitle?title.
 ?paper orkg:hasId?id.
}
```    Note that the URIs used in the SPARQL query are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual URIs from the ORKG RDF dump. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve research papers that have performed benchmarks on the SciERC dataset. It filters the results to only include papers that have a benchmark with a dataset that is the SciERC dataset. The query then returns the title and ID of each paper. 

    The placeholders in the SPARQL query should be replaced with the actual URIs from the ORKG RDF dump. The URIs are in the format `http://example.org/orkgr/<dataset_name>`, where `<dataset_name>` is the name of the dataset. In this case, the SciERC dataset has the URI `http://example.org/orkgr/SciERC_dataset`. 

    The `orkg:hasBenchmark` and `orkg:hasDataset` properties are used to link the research papers to the benchmarks and datasets they have performed on. The `orkg:hasTitle` and `orkg:hasId` properties are used to retrieve the title and ID of each paper. 

    The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include papers that have a benchmark with the SciERC dataset. 

    The `SELECT` clause specifies the variables that should be returned in the query results. In this case, the query returns the paper, title, and ID. 

    The `WHERE` clause specifies the conditions under which the query should return results. In this case, the query returns results if a paper has a benchmark with a dataset that is the SciERC dataset. 

    The `PREFIX` clauses are used to define the prefixes for the RDF schema and the ORKG. The prefixes are used to simplify the query by avoiding the need to write out the full URIs. 

    The `?` symbol is used to represent variables in the query. In this case, `?paper` represents the research paper, `?title` represents the title of the paper, and `?id` represents the ID of the paper. 

    The `<` and `>` symbols are used to represent literal values in the query. In this case, `<http://example.org/orkgr/SciERC_dataset>` represents the SciERC dataset. 

    The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results based on a condition. In this case, the condition is that the dataset must be the SciERC dataset. 

    The `SELECT` clause specifies the variables that should be returned in the query results. In this case, the query returns the paper, title, and ID. 

    The `WHERE` clause specifies the conditions under which the query should return results. In this case, the query returns results if a paper has a benchmark with a dataset that is the SciERC dataset.
