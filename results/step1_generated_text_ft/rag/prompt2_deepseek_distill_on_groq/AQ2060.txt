Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The question is asking for links to code used in papers that benchmark the BERTwwm + SQuAD 2 model. 

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "BERTwwm + SQuAD 2 model" and "code links." The properties involved are "benchmark" and "used in papers."

Looking at the context, I see that there are two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a method involving steps for named entity recognition, which might relate to models like BERT. R284316 is a journal article about extracting entity knowledge using tools like Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight. 

I need to find if there are any links or URIs in the context that point to code. In R284317, there's a URL "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075" which might be a paper. However, this doesn't directly link to code. 

Since the context doesn't provide explicit code links, I'll have to infer based on the models and papers mentioned. BERTwwm is a variant of BERT, and SQuAD is a dataset. The context mentions models like SVM and datasets like MNIST, but not specifically BERT or SQuAD. 

I'll check if any of the resources have URLs or DOIs that could lead to code. R284317 has a DOI, which might be a paper that uses or benchmarks BERT models. 

So, I'll structure the answer by extracting the terms and then provide the relevant URI from the context as a candidate, even though it's not a direct code link. This way, the user can follow up by accessing the paper which might contain the code links.
