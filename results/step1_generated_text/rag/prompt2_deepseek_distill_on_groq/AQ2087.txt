Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the query: "List the code links in papers that use the Multi-Perspective Match (ensemble) model in any benchmark?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll break down the query to identify the key terms. The main entities here are "Multi-Perspective Match (ensemble) model" and "code links in papers." The action is "list," which implies retrieving specific information about these entities.

Looking at the context information, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there's a resource R147246 with authors and a venue, and another resource R284316 that's a journal article with a DOI link. The predicates include things like P27 for authors, HAS_VENUE, and P5044 for the type of publication.

I need to extract terms related to the model and code links. The model in question is "Multi-Perspective Match (ensemble)," which I don't see explicitly mentioned, but maybe it's related to the methods described in the context. The code links would be URLs or DOIs associated with papers, like "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075" in resource R284317.

Next, I'll compute similarity scores. Since the model isn't directly mentioned, I'll look for related concepts. Resource R284316 discusses entity recognition and linking, which might be similar. The DOI link in R284317 is a strong match for code links.

Finally, I'll select the top candidates. The DOI from R284317 is the most relevant code link. For the model, even though it's not explicitly named, R284316's discussion on entity linking tools might be the closest match.

So, I'll structure the answer with the extracted terms and their top candidates, including the DOI as the code link and the related resource as the model.
