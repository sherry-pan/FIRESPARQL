Question:
What is the best performing model benchmarking the Reacher, easy (DMControl100k) dataset in terms of Score metric?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
     PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
SELECT?model?dataset?metric?score
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:hasModel?benchmarking.
 ?benchmarking orkgr:benchmarking?dataset.
 ?benchmarking orkgr:benchmarking?score.
  FILTER (lang(?model) = 'en' AND?model = 'best performing model').
  FILTER (lang(?dataset) = 'en' AND?dataset = 'Reacher, easy (DMControl100k) dataset').
  FILTER (lang(?score) = 'en' AND?score = 'Score metric').
}
```sparql

    Note: The SPARQL query provided is just a sample. It may not be the correct SPARQL query for the given input question. It is expected that you will have to modify it to get the correct answer. The SPARQL query should be able to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question.

    To get the correct answer, you need to:
    1. Understand the context provided.
    2. Identify the correct entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    3. Use the provided candidates to link the correct entities and properties.
    4. Modify the SPARQL query to use the correct entities and properties.
    5. Test the SPARQL query to get the correct answer.
    6. If necessary, refine the SPARQL query to get the correct answer. 

    Note: The provided SPARQL query is just a sample. It may not be the correct SPARQL query for the given input question. It is expected that you will have to modify it to get the correct answer. 

    The output of the SPARQL query should be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the best performing model, the Reacher, easy (DMControl100k) dataset, the Score metric, and the score. The output should be in the format: `(model, dataset, metric, score)`. 

    Example output:
    ```
    (model, dataset, metric, score)
    ```
    where model is the best performing model, dataset is the Reacher, easy (DMControl100k) dataset, metric is the Score metric, and score is the score.

    Note: The output format
