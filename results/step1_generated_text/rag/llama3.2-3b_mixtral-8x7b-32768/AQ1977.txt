Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the STREET model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
     PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>

SELECT?paper?code
WHERE {
 ?paper orkp:HAS_PAPER?paperPaper.
 ?paper orkp:HAS_CODE?code.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgr:R147246.
}
```
    Note: The actual ORKG URIs may vary based on the actual schema of the ORKG.
    The query is based on the assumption that the `paperPaper` variable is the result of the `ORKG:hasPaper` predicate applied to the paper entity. The `code` variable is the result of the `ORKG:hasCode` predicate applied to the paper entity. The `benchmark` variable is the result of the `ORKG:hasBenchmark` predicate applied to the paper entity. The `street` variable is the result of the `ORKG:hasStreetModel` predicate applied to the benchmark entity. 
    The query is also assuming that the `ORKG:hasStreetModel` predicate is a subclass of `ORKG:hasBenchmark` which is a subclass of `ORKG:hasPaper`. The `ORKG:hasStreetModel` predicate is assumed to be the one that connects the paper to the STREET model.

    Please note that this is a simplified query and actual query might need to consider more complex relationships and nuances in the ORKG schema.

    To get the actual query, you would need to replace the `ORKG:` prefixes with the actual prefixes used in the ORKG schema. The actual prefixes may vary based on the actual schema of the ORKG.
