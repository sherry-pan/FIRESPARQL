Question:
List the code links in papers that use the Multi-Perspective Matching (ensemble) model in any benchmark?

## Step 1: Identify the main entities and action in the query
The main entities are "Multi-Perspective Match (ensemble) model" and "code links in papers." The action is "list," which implies retrieving specific information about these entities.

## Step 2: Extract terms related to the model and code links
The model in question is "Multi-Perspective Match (ensemble)," which is related to the methods described in the context. The code links would be URLs or DOIs associated with papers.

## Step 3: Compute similarity scores
Since the model isn't directly mentioned, we look for related concepts. Resource R284316 discusses entity recognition and linking, which might be similar.

## Step 4: Select the top candidates
The DOI from R284317 is the most relevant code link. For the model, even though it's not explicitly named, R284316's discussion on entity linking tools might be the closest match.

## Step 5: Structure the answer with the extracted terms and their top candidates
The extracted terms and their top candidates include the DOI as the code link and the related resource as the model.

## Step 6: Generate the SPARQL query
The SPARQL query should be able to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question.

## Step 7: Write the SPARQL query

PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
