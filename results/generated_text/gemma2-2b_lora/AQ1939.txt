Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Concept Mention Extraction model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
SELECT DISTINCT ?code
    WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P31 ?contrib.
      ?contrib orkgp:P3300 ?code.
      ?code rdfs:label ?code_lbl.
      FILTER(REGEX(?code_lbl, "Concept Mention Extraction"))
    }
<eos>
