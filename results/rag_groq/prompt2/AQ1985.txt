Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking for a list of papers that have used the BART model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information. I see two main resources: R147652 and R284316, along with their properties. 

Looking at R147652, it describes a research method with five steps. It mentions using SciBERT and a CRF algorithm. There's no mention of BART here, so this might not be relevant.

Next, R284316 is a journal article titled "validation research" and uses techniques like Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL. It also mentions using background knowledge resources like YAGO, DBpedia, and Wikidata. The authors are from Italy, and it was published in 2021. The URL is provided as http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075. 

Since the question is about papers using BART, I don't see BART mentioned in the context. However, R284316 is a paper that uses various NLP tools, but not BART. 

Given that, I can't find any information about BART in the provided context. Therefore, the answer should indicate that there are no relevant papers in the context that use BART. 

I should structure the JSON response as per the example, extracting "BART model" and "code" as terms. Since there are no candidates, the lists will be empty.

```json
{
  "question": "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the BART model and include the links to their code?",
  "extracted_terms": [
    {
      "rdfs:label": "BART model",
      "uri": "orkgr:BART_model",
      "type": "Model",
      "rdf:type": "orkgc:Resource"
    },
    {
      "rdfs:label": "code",
      "type": "Property",
      "rdf:type": "orkgp:Predicate"
    }
  ],
  "candidates": {
    "BART model": [],
    "code": []
  }
}
```
