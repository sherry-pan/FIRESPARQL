Question:
What is the best performing model benchmarking the ImageNet 64x64 dataset in terms of Bits per dim metric?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset?metric
WHERE {
 ?model orkgr:R122689 orkgc:Dataset?dataset.
 ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?m.
 ?m orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
  FILTER (?metric rdfs:label?bitsPerDimMetric.
   ?bitsPerDimMetric rdfs:label "Bits per dim metric".
  )
 ?model orkgr:R122689 orkgc:Dataset?dataset.
 ?m orkgp:HAS_MODEL?m.
 ?m orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
  FILTER (?metric rdfs:label?bitsPerDimMetric.
   ?bitsPerDimMetric rdfs:label "Bits per dim metric".
  )
}
```


Note that the answer should be a SPARQL query, not the output of a SPARQL query. The provided answer query has two identical blocks, which is not necessary. The second block can be removed. Here is the corrected answer:


     ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset?metric
WHERE {
 ?model orkgr:R122689 orkgc:Dataset?dataset.
 ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?m.
 ?m orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
  FILTER (?metric rdfs:label?bitsPerDimMetric.
   ?bitsPerDimMetric rdfs:label "Bits per dim metric".
  )
}```


    Note: The question mentions "best performing model", so the answer query should only consider models that have a metric named "Bits per dim metric". This is done by filtering the results with the `?metric rdfs:label?bitsPerDimMetric` condition. Also, the `?bitsPerDimMetric` variable is assumed to be bound to the correct value by the SPARQL query engine. If not, the query will need to be modified to include additional logic to determine the correct value. 

    Also note that the SPARQL query does not include the "64x64" part of the question, since this is not a property of the dataset or the metric, but rather a characteristic of the dataset. 

    Finally, the SPARQL query assumes that the dataset and the metric are related to the "best performing model", but does not specify how to determine the best performing model. This would require additional logic to be added to the query. 

    The provided answer query is a basic query that returns the model, dataset and metric, but it may not
