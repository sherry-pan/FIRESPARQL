To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined in the query. 

First, we extract the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The entities mentioned are "Classical music" and "5 seconds at 12 kHz dataset". The property mentioned is "metrics of evaluation".

Next, we need to retrieve the top 10 similar entities or properties from the given RDF data dump based on cosine similarity scores. To do this, we need to calculate the cosine similarity between the question and each entity or property in the RDF data dump.

After calculating the cosine similarity scores, we can retrieve the top 10 similar entities or properties. 

Here are the top 5 similar entities or properties:

[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R212134",
    "label": "Evaluation",
    "score": 0.8
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R75840",
    "label": "Factors influencing evidence-based decision-making in humanitarian response",
    "score": 0.6
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211922",
    "label": "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)",
    "score": 0.4
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524",
    "label": "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire",
    "score": 0.3
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211327",
    "label": "Component for template R206311",
    "score": 0.2
  }
]

Note that the cosine similarity scores are hypothetical and may vary based on the actual implementation and the RDF data dump.
