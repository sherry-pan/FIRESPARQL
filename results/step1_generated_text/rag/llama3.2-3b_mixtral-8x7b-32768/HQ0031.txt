Question:
What coolant does ASTRID reactor use?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?coolant 
     WHERE {
   ?coolant rdfs:label "Coolant"@en.
   ?ASTRID?coolant.
    }
    FILTER (CONTAINS(LANG(?coolant), 'en') OR CONTAINS(LANG(?coolant), 'en@abbr') ) 
    FILTER (?ASTRID rdfs:label "ASTRID reactor"@en.) 
    ```



    SELECT?coolant 
    WHERE {
   ?coolant rdfs:label "Coolant"@en.
   ?ASTRID?coolant.
    }
    FILTER (CONTAINS(LANG(?coolant), 'en') OR CONTAINS(LANG(?coolant), 'en@abbr') ) 
    FILTER (?ASTRID rdfs:label "ASTRID reactor"@en.
    }```


    If the answer to the question is not found in the ORKG, return a message saying that the answer cannot be found.
    If the answer to the question is found, return the answer in the format "The answer is [answer]".


    Here is the code that implements the above specification:


    ```python
import pyontology as po

def get_sparql_query(question, context):
    # Initialize the ontology
    ontology = po.load_ontology('https://example.org/ontology.rdf')

    # Create a query
    query = po.create_query(ontology)

    # Define the query
    query.add_statement(po.Statement(
        'SELECT?coolant',
        'WHERE {?coolant rdfs:label "Coolant"@en.?ASTRID?coolant. }',
        'FILTER (CONTAINS(LANG(?coolant), \'en\') OR CONTAINS(LANG(?coolant), \'en@abbr\') ) FILTER (?ASTRID rdfs:label "ASTRID reactor"@en.)'
    ))

    # Execute the query
    result = query.execute()

    # Check if the answer is found
    if len(result) > 0:
        # Return the answer
        answer = result[0].value
        return f'The answer is {answer}'
    else:
        # Return a message saying that the answer cannot be found
        return 'The answer cannot be found.'

# Test the function
question = 'What coolant does ASTRID reactor use?'
context = {
    "question": "What coolant does ASTRID reactor use?",
    "extracted_terms": {
        "ASTRID reactor",
        "coolant"
    },
    "candidates": {
        "ASTRID reactor": [
            {
                "uri": "orkgr:R123456",
                "rdfs:label": "ASTRID reactor",
                "rdf:type": "orkgc:Resource"
            }
        ],
        "coolant": [
            {
                "uri": "orkgp:COOLANT",
                "rdfs:label": "Coolant",
                "rdf:type": "orkgp:Predicate"
            }
        ]
    }
}

print(get_sparql_query(question, context))
```
