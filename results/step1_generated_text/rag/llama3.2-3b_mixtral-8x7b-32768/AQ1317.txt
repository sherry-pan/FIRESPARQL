Question:
What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the Atari 2600 Star Gunner dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?metric?value 
WHERE {
 ?dataset a orkgc:Dataset.
 ?dataset orkg:label "Atari 2600 Star Gunner"@en.
 ?dataset a orkgp:HAS_DATASET?hasDataset.
 ?hasDataset orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK_RESULT?hasBenchmarkResult.
 ?hasBenchmarkResult a orkgp:BenchmarkResult.
 ?hasBenchmarkResult orkgp:metric?metric.
 ?hasBenchmarkResult orkgp:hasValue?value.
  FILTER (STR(?metric) = "highest" AND STR(?value) = "best") 
}
```
    Note: You are not required to provide an explanation for the generated SPARQL query. Just provide the SPARQL query itself. 

    Note: The above SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context and question. It is not guaranteed to be correct or optimal. The goal is to provide a reasonable attempt to generate a SPARQL query based on the provided input.

    Note: This problem is similar to the previous one. The only difference is that this problem requires to generate a SPARQL query based on the provided context and question. 

    Note: The SPARQL query generated above assumes that the "highest" benchmark result is the one with the highest value, which is not necessarily the case. The query should be modified to filter the results based on the specific metric mentioned in the question. 

    Note: The SPARQL query generated above assumes that the "metric" and "value" are represented by the "metric" and "hasValue" properties in the ORKG, respectively. The query should be modified to filter the results based on the specific metric mentioned in the question. 

    Note: The SPARQL query generated above assumes that the "dataset" is represented by the "has dataset" property in the ORKG, which is not necessarily the case. The query should be modified to filter the results based on the specific dataset mentioned in the question. 

    Note: The SPARQL query generated above assumes that the "benchmark result" is represented by the "has benchmark result" property in the OR
