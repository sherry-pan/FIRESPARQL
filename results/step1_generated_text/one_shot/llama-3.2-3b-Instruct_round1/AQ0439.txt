Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Kinetics-600 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_id?paper_lbl
    WHERE {
     ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset;
                 orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?eval.
     ?dataset a orkgc:Dataset;
               rdfs:label?dataset_lbl.
      FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Kinetics-600")
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model.
     ?model rdfs:label?model_lbl.
     ?paper orkgp:ID?paper_id.
     ?eval orkgp:HAS Paper?paper.
    }
    Note: I made some adjustments to the query to make it more readable. The original query may not be grammatically correct, but it should be syntactically correct.<|eot_id|>
