Question:
Can you provide the highest benchmark result, including the metric and score, for the Softcite dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?metric,?score
WHERE {
 ?benchmark     a                orkgc:Benchmark;
                 rdfs:label      ?benchmark_label.
  FILTER (str(?benchmark_label) = "Softcite")
 ?cont         orkgp:P31      ?benchmark;
                orkgp:P32      ?eval.
 ?eval         orkgp:P29      ?metric;
                orkgp:P30      ?score.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?score)
LIMIT 1
``` 
    Note that the original question was not correctly translated into a SPARQL query. The corrected query should filter the results to only include the Softcite dataset, and then select the highest scoring result. The original query was incorrect because it did not filter the results to only include the Softcite dataset. 

    If you want to get the top results for the Softcite dataset, you can use the following query:
    ```sparql
SELECT?metric,?score
WHERE {
 ?dataset       rdfs:label      ?dataset_label.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_label) = "Softcite")
 ?cont         orkgp:P31      ?dataset;
                orkgp:P32      ?eval.
 ?eval         orkgp:P29      ?metric;
                orkgp:P30      ?score.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?score)
LIMIT 1
``` 
    This query will return the top result for the Softcite dataset. If you want to get the top results for all datasets, you can remove the FILTER clause. 

    To get the top results for all datasets, you can use the following query:
    ```sparql
SELECT?metric,?score
WHERE {
 ?cont         orkgp:P31      ?dataset;
                orkgp:P32      ?eval.
 ?eval         orkgp:P29      ?metric;
                orkgp:P30      ?score.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?score)
LIMIT 1
``` 
    This query will return the top result for all datasets. If you want to get the top results for a specific dataset, you can add a FILTER clause to the WHERE clause. 

    To get the top results for a specific dataset, you can use the following query:
    ```sparql
SELECT?metric,?score
WHERE {
 ?dataset       rdfs:label      ?dataset_label.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_label) = "Softcite")
 ?cont         orkgp:P31      ?dataset;
                orkgp:P32      ?eval.
 ?eval         orkgp:P29      ?metric;
                orkgp:P30      ?score.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?score)
LIMIT 1
