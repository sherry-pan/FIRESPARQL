Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the enwiki8 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?dataset 
    WHERE {
   ?model orkgp:hasModel?model1.
   ?model1 orkgp:hasDataset?dataset.
   ?dataset orkgp:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
   ?evaluation orkgp:evaluationOn?on.
    FILTER (STR(?on) = "enwiki8").
    } 

```

The correct answer to the input question "Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the enwiki8 dataset?" is the following SPARQL query:

```
SELECT?model?dataset 
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:hasModel?model1.
 ?model1 orkgp:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgp:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
 ?evaluation orkgp:evaluationOn?on.
  FILTER (STR(?on) = "enwiki8").
}
```

This SPARQL query retrieves the models that have been evaluated on the enwiki8 dataset. The query first finds models that have a "hasModel" predicate, then finds the datasets that these models are associated with, and finally finds the evaluations that these datasets have been evaluated on. The `FILTER` clause ensures that only evaluations on the enwiki8 dataset are returned. The `?model` and `?dataset` variables are used to retrieve the names of the models and datasets, respectively. 

Note that the `?on` variable is not used in the query, but it is included in the original query to match the structure of the provided context. In a real-world scenario, it would be removed to simplify the query. 

Also, the `?model1` and `?evaluation` variables are not used in the query, but they are included in the original query to match the structure of the provided context. In a real-world scenario, they would be removed to simplify the query. 

The `?model` and `?dataset` variables are used to retrieve the names of the models and datasets, respectively. 

The `FILTER` clause ensures that only evaluations on the enwiki8 dataset are returned. 

The query is written in a way that it can be executed on the ORKG knowledge graph to retrieve the correct answer to the input question.
