Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The query is asking for a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the SciERC dataset. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of the SciERC dataset. From the context, I see that in Step 2 of the process, SciBERT is used as a semantic relatedness method. Wait, SciBERT is a model, not a dataset. Hmm, maybe I'm confusing the two. Let me check again. 

Looking at the context, I don't see any direct mention of the SciERC dataset. The datasets mentioned are MNIST and others, but not SciERC. So, perhaps the context doesn't have information about SciERC. 

Next, I need to extract relevant terms from the query. The key terms here are "research paper titles", "IDs", "benchmarked models", and "SciERC dataset". Since SciERC isn't in the context, I might not find any related papers here. 

Looking at the papers in the context, I see R147246 and R283710. R147246 has authors like Ligia Sierra and others, published in 2015. R283710 is from 2021 with authors like Yuanyuan Wu and others. Neither of these papers mention using the SciERC dataset, as far as I can tell from the context. 

So, since the context doesn't have information about the SciERC dataset, I can't find any relevant papers that benchmarked models on it. Therefore, the answer would be that there are no matching papers in the provided data.
