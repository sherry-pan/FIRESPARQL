Question:
What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the WOS-5736 dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX wos: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/wos/>
     PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>
     SELECT?metric?value 
     WHERE {
       ?wosDataset a orkg:WOSDataset.
       ?wosDataset wos:datasetID "WOS:5736".
       ?benchmark a orkg:Benchmark.
       ?benchmark wos:benchmarkOn?wosDataset.
       ?benchmark wos:benchmarkMetric?metric.
       ?benchmark wos:benchmarkValue?value.
       ?benchmark dcterms:date?benchmarkDate.
        ORDER BY DESC?benchmarkDate 
        LIMIT 1
      } 
      GROUP BY?benchmark
    END OF GROUP BY END OF SELECT END OF WHERE END OF PREFIX END OF query. 

    Note: The query has a group by clause which may not be supported by all ORKG servers. You may need to modify it to work with the server you are using. 
    Also, the query assumes that the benchmark with the highest date is the highest benchmark. This may not be the case in all situations. 
    Depending on the data in the ORKG, the query may return multiple results for the same metric. 

    To answer this question, you would use the query as follows:
    1. Replace the input question with your own natural language question.
    2. Copy the generated SPARQL query.
    3. Send the query to the ORKG server using HTTP POST method.
    4. Parse the response from the ORKG server.
    5. Print the results to the console.
    To make the system more user-friendly, you can add some error checking code to handle the response from the ORKG server.
