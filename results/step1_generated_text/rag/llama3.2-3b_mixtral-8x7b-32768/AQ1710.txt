Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Score metric on the Atari 2600 Freeway benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkgp.org/schema/orkgp#>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://orkgr.org/schema/orkgr#>

SELECT?model?score
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model_model.
 ?model_model orkgr:R131168 orkgr:HAS_BENCHMARK.
 ?model_model orkgr:R131168 orkgr:HAS_DATASET.
 ?model_model orkgp:HAS_METRIC?score_metric.
 ?score_metric rdfs:label?score.
  FILTER (STR(?score) > "0" ).
}
``` sparql
    Note that the answer to the question is the model that performed best in terms of Score metric on the Atari 2600 Freeway benchmark dataset, which is represented as a SPARQL query. 

    The SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context, which includes the extracted terms, candidates, and the context information. The query retrieves the model that performed best in terms of Score metric on the Atari 2600 Freeway benchmark dataset, considering the Score metric is represented by the Score metric predicate, the model is represented by the Model predicate, and the benchmark dataset is represented by the Benchmark Atari 2600 Freeway resource. 

    The query uses the following predicates and resources:
    - orkgp:HAS_MODEL to link the model to its corresponding resource.
    - orkgr:R131168 to link the benchmark dataset to its corresponding resource.
    - orkgr:HAS_BENCHMARK and orkgr:HAS_DATASET to link the benchmark dataset to its corresponding resource.
    - orkg
