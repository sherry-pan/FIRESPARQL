Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the HMDB51 benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc#>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr#>
PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp#>
PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT?model?label?score?type?typeLabel 
WHERE {
 ?model orkgc:isA orkp:Model.
 ?model orkgc:hasProperty?property.
 ?property orkp:hasValue?value.
 ?value orkp:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgr:label?label.
 ?model rdfs:label?modelLabel.
  BIND(1.0 -?score AS?scoreLabel).
  SERVICE orkp:EntitySimilarity {
   ?model orkgc:hasSimilarity?similar.
   ?similar orkp:score?score.
   ?similar orkgr:label?similarLabel.
    FILTER(?score > 0.5).
  }
}
```    Output ends here. 

Note that the SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context and extracted terms. The query is designed to retrieve the desired information from the ORKG RDF data dump. 

Here is a brief explanation of the SPARQL query:

- The query starts by defining the prefixes for the RDF and ORKG namespaces.
- The `SELECT` clause specifies the variables to be retrieved: `?model`, `?label`, `?score`, `?type`, and `?typeLabel`.
- The `WHERE` clause defines the query pattern. It starts by identifying models that are instances of the `orkgc:Model` class.
- The query then checks if each model has a property called `tested on` (defined in the `orkgp` namespace) and if this property has a value that is a dataset (defined in the `orkgr` namespace).
- The query retrieves the label of the dataset and the label of the model.
- The query then uses the `SERVICE` clause to apply the `EntitySimilarity` service, which is used to find similar entities. In this case, the query is looking for models that have a similarity score above 0.5.
- The `BIND` function is used to transform the `score` variable into a label that can be displayed in the output.

Note that this query is just one possible way to generate a SPARQL query based on the provided context and extracted terms. Depending on the specific requirements of the application, additional queries or modifications to this query may be necessary.<|eot_id|>
