    Note: The first part of the query is for filtering the metrics by the presence of the keywords in the question, and the second part is for filtering the metrics by the presence of the keywords in the label of the metrics. 
    The query uses the `CONTAINS` function to check if the keyword is present in the label of the metric. The `LCASE` function is used to make the search case-insensitive. 
    The `FILTER` function is used to filter the metrics based on the presence of the keywords. 
    The `SEPARATOR` function is used to combine the two SELECT statements into one query. 
    The `;` is used to separate the two SELECT statements. 
    The `OR` operator is used to combine the conditions in the `FILTER` clause. 
    The `AND` operator is not used because it is not necessary in this case. 
    The `?metric` variable is used to represent the metric, and the `?metricLabel` variable is used to represent the label of the metric. 
    The `?metric` variable is used in the first SELECT statement to retrieve the metric, and the `?metricLabel` variable is used in the second SELECT statement to retrieve the label of the metric. 
    The `rdfs:label` property is used to get the label of the metric.
