Okay, so I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question: "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Adaptive Input Large model and include the links to their code?" 

First, I'll break down the question. It's asking for papers that used a specific model (Adaptive Input Large) and wants links to their code. So, I need properties that relate to papers, their usage of models, and code links.

Looking at the JSON, I see a list of properties with their labels. I'll go through each one to see if it fits.

1. "method" - This seems relevant because the question is about a specific method or model used in papers.
2. "implementation" - This could relate to how the model is implemented, which might include code links.
3. "evaluation" - While important, it's more about results rather than the model's usage or code.
4. "has dataset" - Not directly related to code or model usage.
5. "approach" - Similar to method, could be useful but "method" is more specific.
6. "has benchmark" - More about evaluation metrics, not code.
7. "has mesh" - Doesn't seem relevant here.

So, the most relevant properties are "method" and "implementation". "method" because it directly relates to the model used, and "implementation" because it might link to code or how the model was applied in the paper.

The most relevant properties from the JSON file that could help answer the question are:

[
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_METHOD",
    "label": "method",
    "reason": "This property is relevant because it relates to the specific method or model used in the papers, which in this case is the Adaptive Input Large model."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_IMPLEMENTATION",
    "label": "implementation",
    "reason": "This property is relevant because it could provide information about how the model was implemented, potentially including links to code or repositories."
  }
