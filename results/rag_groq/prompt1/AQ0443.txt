Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this question using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the UCF101 (finetuned) dataset. 

First, I should look through the context information to find any mentions of research papers. The context has several entries with URIs like <http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524>, which is labeled as "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire". Another one is R211922, titled "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)". There's also R211327, which is another paper but the title isn't specified in the context. 

I don't see any mention of the UCF101 dataset in the provided context. The papers listed are about named entity recognition and neural modeling, which don't seem related to UCF101. Since the context doesn't include any information about benchmarking on UCF101, I can't retrieve any relevant entities or properties. 

Therefore, the top similar entities based on the given context would be the papers mentioned, but none of them are related to UCF101. So, the answer would be an empty list because there's no relevant data in the context.

The context provided does not contain any information related to the UCF101 dataset or benchmarking models on it. Therefore, there are no relevant entities or properties to retrieve.
