Okay, I need to figure out where the study with the maximal geographic scale took place based on the provided ORKG RDF data. Let me start by understanding the question. The user is asking about a study's location that has the largest geographic coverage.

First, I'll look through the context information to find relevant data. The context includes several RDF triples. I see that there are resources like R147246 and R283710, which seem to be studies or papers. Each has properties like P27 (authors), P28 (volume), P29 (year), and others.

I need to find the study with the maximal geographic scale. The term "geographic scale" isn't directly mentioned, but perhaps it relates to the number of organizations or countries involved. Looking at the context, I see that R147246 has multiple authors from different institutions, possibly indicating a larger study. The analysis mentions 32,090 funded projects and 34,295 organizations, which suggests a large-scale study.

The resource R147246 is associated with authors like Ligia Sierra, Betty L LÃ³pez, Flavio Forni, Maria Angela Vandelli, Michele Zoli, and Antonietta Vilella. These names might be from different institutions or countries, implying a wide geographic scope.

R283710 is another resource with authors Yuanyuan Wu, Mengxing Huang, Zhaocheng Tu, and Siling Feng. This could be another study, but without more context, it's hard to determine its scale.

Since R147246 has more authors and is linked to a higher number of projects and organizations, it's likely the study with the maximal geographic scale. The authors' affiliations might be spread across more regions, but the exact location isn't provided. However, the study's details are under R147246, so the location is associated with that resource.

I should structure the answer to reflect that the study in question is R147246, providing its URI and relevant details. Since the exact location isn't specified, I'll note that the geographic scale is maximal based on the number of participants and projects involved.
