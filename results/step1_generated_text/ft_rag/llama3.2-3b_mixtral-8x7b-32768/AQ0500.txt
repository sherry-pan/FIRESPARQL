Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset")
        ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
        ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
        ?paper         orkgp:TAKES_BENCHMARK     ?cont.
        ?paper         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
     }
     ```
    The provided context and the question can be used to generate the correct SPARQL query. The query can be broken down into the following steps:

    1.  **Get the dataset with the label "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset"**: We use the `FILTER` function with the `str(?dataset_lbl)` to match the label of the dataset. We then use the `?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;` to get the dataset.
2.  **Get the benchmarking dataset**: We use the `?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.` to get the dataset that is related to the dataset we obtained in the previous step.
3.  **Get the contributions that are related to the benchmarking dataset**: We use the `?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.` to get the contributions that are related to the benchmarking dataset.
4.  **Get the papers that are related to the contributions**: We use the `?paper         orkgp:TAKES_BENCHMARK     ?cont.` to get the papers that are related to the contributions.
5.  **Get the labels of the papers**: We use the `?paper         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.` to get the labels of the papers.

    The final SPARQL query is the combination of the above steps, with the `SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl` statement to get the distinct paper labels. The complete query is provided in the problem statement. The query is written in a way that it will return the list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset. 

    The query can be executed on the ORKG to get the desired answer.

    ```sparql
    SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
    WHERE {
     ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                     rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset
