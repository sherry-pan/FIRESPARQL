Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the SciCite dataset, along with their titles and IDs.

First, I'll look through the context information. The context has two main sections from the ORKG RDF dump. The first part describes a resource R147652, which outlines a method involving steps like seed terms, expansion, annotation, NER approach, and filtering. It also mentions some metrics and authors, but nothing about the SciCite dataset.

The second part of the context describes resource R284316, which is a journal article titled "validation research" and "technique." It discusses extracting entity knowledge using NLP tools and models like jpark. The authors include Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta, and it's published in 2021. However, this also doesn't mention the SciCite dataset.

Since the context doesn't provide any information about the SciCite dataset or any papers benchmarking it, I can't extract relevant terms or compute similarities. Therefore, the candidates list will be empty because there's no matching data in the provided context.
