Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the Atari 2600 Double Dunk dataset, including the metric and its value?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. 

First, I should understand the structure of the data. The data is in Turtle format, which is a way to represent RDF (Resource Description Framework) data. Each line represents a triple, which consists of a subject, predicate, and object. The subjects are URIs, predicates are also URIs, and objects can be URIs or literals.

Looking at the context, I see multiple resources with labels that start with "Benchmark" or "Evaluation". For example, there's "Benchmark iNaturalist 2019" and "Benchmark ImageNet V2". Each of these benchmarks has associated evaluations with metrics like "Top-1 Accuracy" and their respective values.

The question is asking about the "Atari 2600 Double Dunk dataset". I need to check if this dataset is mentioned in the provided context. Scanning through the context, I don't see any benchmark or evaluation related to Atari 2600 or Double Dunk. The benchmarks mentioned are iNaturalist 2019, ImageNet V2, ImageNet ReaL, and ImageNet. None of these are related to Atari.

Since the context doesn't contain any information about the Atari 2600 Double Dunk dataset, there are no relevant entities or properties to retrieve. Therefore, the top similar entities or properties based on the question would be none because the dataset isn't present in the provided data.

I should make sure that I'm not introducing any prior knowledge, only using the given context. So, I can't assume any benchmarks or results for Atari 2600 Double Dunk because it's not in the data. 

In conclusion, the answer is that there are no relevant entities or properties in the provided data that relate to the Atari 2600 Double Dunk dataset.
