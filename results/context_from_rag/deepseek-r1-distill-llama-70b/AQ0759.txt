Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the 200k Short Texts for Humor Detection benchmark dataset. The question is asking about metrics used, so I should look for properties related to evaluation, benchmarks, and performance measurement.

First, I'll go through each property and its label to see if it relates to evaluation metrics. 

I see properties like "evaluation" with label "evaluation" (P71075). That seems directly relevant because it's about the process of assessing model performance. Then there's "Recall" (P71079), "micro-F1" (P71080), "Accuracy" (P71081), and "macro-F1" (P71082). These are all common evaluation metrics used in machine learning tasks, so they fit the context of model evaluation.

Next, "has benchmark" (P71068) is another relevant property because benchmarks are standard datasets used for evaluation, which aligns with the 200k Short Texts dataset mentioned in the question.

I also notice "has dataset" (P71086), which could be useful since the question is about a specific dataset. However, it's more about the dataset itself rather than the metrics, so it might be less directly relevant but still worth considering.

Looking further, properties like "number of type" (P71066) and "no of labels" (P71083) might relate to the dataset's characteristics, which can influence the choice of evaluation metrics, but they aren't metrics themselves.

There's also "data splitting method" (P71067) and "validation set" (P71096), which are about how data is divided for training and testing. While important for evaluation processes, they aren't metrics but rather methodologies.

Considering all this, the most relevant properties are those that directly correspond to evaluation metrics and benchmarking. So, I'll list "evaluation", "Recall", "micro-F1", "Accuracy", "macro-F1", and "has benchmark" as the key properties.
