Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the RotoWire (Relation Generation) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "RotoWire (Relation Generation)")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
      ?eval           orkgp:HAS_VALUE        ?value.
       OPTIONAL {?eval           orkgp:HAS_PAPER        ?paper.
                ?paper            orkgp:HAS TitLe        ?paper_lbl.}
     }<|eot_id|>
