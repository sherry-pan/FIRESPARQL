    Note: The model id and metric id are placeholders and should be replaced with actual model id and metric id respectively. 
    Also, the above query is for a specific model. If you want to query for multiple models, you would need to add a union operator or use a more complex query. 
    For a more complex query, please provide more context or details about the question.

    For a more complex query, please provide more context or details about the model or metric. 
    The query is also case-sensitive. 
    Therefore, it is recommended to use the query in a case-insensitive manner by using the `LOWER` function. 
    To make the query case-insensitive, please replace the `regex` function with `lower` and `i` flag with no flag. 
    However, the `LOWER` function would require the use of `BNode` to avoid the `UNION ALL` operator. 
    This is a limitation of the SPARQL query language. 
    Therefore, it is recommended to use a case-insensitive query language like SPARQL 1.1 Query Language.
