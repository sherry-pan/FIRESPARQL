Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Score metric on the Atari 2600 Crazy Climber benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
SELECT?model?scoremetric?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?scoremetric.
 ?scoremetric orkgp:HAS_SCORE_METRIC?dataset.
 ?model orkgr:R122689 orkgr:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?scoremetric)
```



## Step 1: Identify the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
The entities and properties mentioned in the question are:
- model
- performed best
- Score metric
- Atari 2600 Crazy Climber benchmark dataset

## Step 2: Match the entities and properties with the candidates provided in the context.
The candidates provided in the context are:
- model: orkgp:HAS_MODEL
- performed best: orkgp:PERFORMED_BEST
- Score metric: orkgp:HAS_SCORE_METRIC
- Atari 2600 Crazy Climber benchmark dataset: orkgr:R122689

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query based on the matched entities and properties.
To construct the SPARQL query, we need to join the entities and properties from the question with the candidates from the context. The query should get the model that performed best in terms of Score metric on the Atari 2600 Crazy Climber benchmark dataset.

```sparql
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
SELECT?model?scoremetric?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?scoremetric.
 ?scoremetric orkgp:HAS_SCORE_METRIC?dataset.
 ?model orkgr:R122689 orkgr:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?scoremetric)
```
