Okay, so I need to figure out the top model in terms of the number of parameters when evaluated on the Penn Treebank character-level dataset. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll look at the context provided. The context includes several RDF triples from an ORKG dump. I see that there are resources like R147652, which has multiple steps described. These steps talk about methods, datasets, named entity recognition, and so on. There's also information about projects, organizations, and public deliverables, but that might not be directly relevant here.

Looking further, I see some resources like R147244 with a value of 93.9, which could be a score or some metric. Then there are resources like R147246 and R147247, which mention authors and the year 2015. Another resource, R283709, is a journal article with various predicates like "method", "solution proposal", and "entity extraction". It also lists some keywords like "Graph analytics", "Horizon 2020", "Keyphrase extraction", etc. R283710 mentions authors like Yuanyuan Wu and others, published in 2021.

Now, the question is about the top model based on the number of parameters (params) when benchmarked on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset. So, I need to find models that have been evaluated on this specific dataset and then determine which one has the highest number of parameters.

In the context, I don't see any direct mention of the Penn Treebank dataset or models evaluated on it. The datasets mentioned are SVM and MNIST in the initial steps, but those are different. The other resources talk about projects and articles, not specific models or their performance metrics on Penn Treebank.

Since the context doesn't provide the necessary information about models, their parameters, or their performance on the Penn Treebank dataset, I can't extract any relevant terms or candidates from it. Therefore, the extracted terms would be empty, and there are no candidates to list.

I should structure the JSON response accordingly, showing that no relevant terms or candidates were found based on the provided context.

```json
{
  "question": "What is the name of the top performing model in terms of Number of params score when benchmarked on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset?",
  "extracted_terms": {
    "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset": "",
    "Number of params score": "",
    "top performing model": ""
  },
  "candidates": {
    "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset": [],
    "Number of params score": [],
    "top performing model": []
  }
}
```
