Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking for links to code used in papers that benchmark the FG fine-grained gate model. 

First, I'll break down the question. The key terms here are "papers," "benchmark," and "FG fine-grained gate model." I need to extract these terms to find relevant entities and properties in the ORKG data.

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources related to papers, such as R147246 and R283710, which have properties like P27 (authors), P29 (year), and P28 (volume). These are likely papers that might have been benchmarked. 

Next, I need to find properties related to benchmarking. In the context, I see P5044 which is "Journal Article," and P41924 which is "scholarly domain." There's also P97003 as "entity extraction" and P97004 as "solution proposal." These might be relevant for benchmarking.

For the FG fine-grained gate model, I don't see a direct mention, but there are mentions of models like "SVM" and datasets like "MNIST." However, since the model in question isn't in the context, I'll have to infer based on related terms.

I'll structure the JSON output as per the example, grouping the results by the extracted terms. Each term will have a list of candidates with their URIs, labels, and types. 

I'll make sure to use the correct RDF prefixes: "orkgr:" for resources, "orkgp:" for properties, and "orkgc:" for classes. Also, I'll include the rdf:type information for each candidate.

Since the exact model isn't present, I'll include general resources and properties that relate to benchmarking and papers, assuming they might be connected to the FG model indirectly.

Finally, I'll format the JSON, ensuring each extracted term has up to five candidates, each with the required details. I'll avoid any markdown and keep the structure clean.
