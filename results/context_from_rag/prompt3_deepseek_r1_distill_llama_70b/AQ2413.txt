Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user's question is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the CvT-21 (384 res) model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "papers" and "CvT-21 (384 res) model". The property mentioned is "utilized" and "links to their code". 

Looking at the context data, I see that there are several resources related to papers, such as R147246 and R283710, which have properties like P27 (authors), P28 (issue), P29 (year), and P31 (type). There are also resources like R147652 which describe steps in a method, but I'm not sure if they're relevant here.

I need to find entities similar to "papers" and "CvT-21 model". In the context, I see that R147246 and R283710 are both papers with authors and publication details. However, I don't see any mention of the CvT-21 model in the provided context. This might be a problem because without any data about the model, I can't find similar entities.

Since the context doesn't include information about the CvT-21 model, I can't retrieve any specific papers that used it. Therefore, the candidates for "CvT-21 (384 res) model" would be empty. Similarly, without knowing the model, I can't find papers that utilized it.

I should structure the JSON output as per the example, grouping the results by the extracted terms. For "papers", I can include the existing paper resources from the context, but for the model, there won't be any matches. The properties like "utilized" and "links to their code" also don't have corresponding data in the context, so their candidates will be empty as well.

In summary, the response will list the papers found in the context but won't have any information related to the CvT-21 model or code links since that data isn't present.
