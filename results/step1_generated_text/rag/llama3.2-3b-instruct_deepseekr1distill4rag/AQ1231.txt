    The SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG and retrieve the top benchmark score and its metric on the Cheetah, run (D4RL-500k) dataset. The query uses the specified RDF prefixes and types, and it filters the results based on the extracted terms and candidates. The query retrieves the score and metric values and binds them as strings for use in the final output.
