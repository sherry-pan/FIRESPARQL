Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the XLNet-Large model?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <https://orkg.io/ontology/> 
     SELECT?paper?link 
     WHERE {?paper orkg:hasCode?code. 
      ?code orkg:codeUsedIn?benchmarkPaper. 
      ?benchmarkPaper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark. 
      ?benchmark orkg:hasBenchmarkModel?model. 
      ?model orkg:modelName "XLNet-Large". 
      ?paper orkg:hasPaperAuthor?author. 
      ?author orkg:hasPublication?publication. 
      ?publication orkg:hasPublicationLink?link. 
       FILTER (STRLEN(?link) > 0) 
     } 
     ORDER BY DESC (STRLEN(?link)) 
     LIMIT 10 
    )

    The answer to the question is a list of 10 links to code used in papers that benchmark the XLNet-Large model. 
    The answer is ordered by the length of the link, longest first. 
    The answer is limited to the first 10 links. 
    The answer is only returned if the link is not empty.
