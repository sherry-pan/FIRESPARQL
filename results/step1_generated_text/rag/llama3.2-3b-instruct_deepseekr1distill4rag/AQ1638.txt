Question:
Which model has achieved the highest Score score on the Ball in cup, catch (DMControl100k) benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://orkp.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkc: <http://orkc.org/ontology/>

SELECT?model?dataset?score
WHERE {
 ?model orkp:hasModel?modelModel.
 ?modelModel orkp:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkg:hasScore?score.
  FILTER (STR(?dataset) = "Ball in cup, catch (DMControl100k)"@en)
  FILTER (?score >= 0.93)
}
``` 
    The SPARQL query retrieves the model with the highest score on the Ball in cup, catch (DMControl100k) benchmark dataset. The query uses the `orkg` and `orkp` prefixes to access the ORKG and ORKP ontologies, respectively. The `SELECT` clause specifies the variables to be retrieved, and the `WHERE` clause filters the results based on the extracted terms and candidates. The `FILTER` clause checks for the presence of the benchmark dataset and the score of 0.93 or higher.<|eot_id|>
