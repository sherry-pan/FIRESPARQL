Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the BART model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?paperCode 
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgc:hasModel?bargraphicalModel.
 ?paper orkgc:hasCode?paperCode.
 ?bargraphicalModel rdfs:label "BART model"@en.
  FILTER (REGEX(str(?paperCode), "https?://[^\s]+") && REGEX(str(?paperCode), "github.com/")).
}
```    Note: The SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the Open Research Knowledge Graph. This is just an example. 

    If the answer is "There are no relevant papers in the context that use BART", the JSON response should be:

    ```json
{
  "question": "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the BART model and include the links to their code?",
