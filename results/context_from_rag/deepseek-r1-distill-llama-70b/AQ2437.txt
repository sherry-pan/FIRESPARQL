Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to answer the question using the provided JSON context. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the BiT-S (ResNet) model and include links to their code. 

First, I need to identify which properties from the JSON are relevant. The JSON contains various properties related to ORKG, like evaluation metrics, dataset details, methods, etc. 

I think the key here is to find properties that relate to methods, implementations, datasets, and possibly where code might be linked. So, looking through the JSON, properties like "method", "implementation", "has dataset", and "evaluation" seem relevant because they can point to where the model is used and how it's applied. 

"Method" (label: method) would help identify papers that used specific models. "Implementation" (label: implementation) might link to code or repositories. "Has dataset" could show which datasets were used with the model. "Evaluation" might provide results or comparisons that include the model's performance.

I don't see a direct property for code links, but "implementation" might serve that purpose. So, these four properties seem like the best fit to help answer the question.

The most relevant properties from the JSON that could help answer the question about papers using the BiT-S (ResNet) model and their code links are:

[
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_METHOD",
    "label": "method",
    "reason": "Identifies the method used in the paper, which could be the BiT-S (ResNet) model."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_IMPLEMENTATION",
    "label": "implementation",
    "reason": "Links to the implementation details or code repository of the method."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_DATASET",
    "label": "has dataset",
    "reason": "Specifies the dataset used, which might be relevant for the BiT-S model application."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_EVALUATION",
    "label": "evaluation",
    "reason": "Provides evaluation results or comparisons involving the BiT-S model."
  }
]
