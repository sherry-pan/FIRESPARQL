Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the ShARe/CLEF eHealth corpus dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>

PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/#>

    Note: The SPARQL query is in the format of the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). The prefix declarations are assumed to be defined elsewhere, and the query is written in a way that assumes the existence of certain entities, properties, and relationships in the ORKG. The query is designed to retrieve the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the ShARe/CLEF eHealth corpus dataset. 

    The query works as follows:

    1. It starts by selecting the titles and IDs of research papers.
    2. It then filters the results to only include papers that have a benchmark.
    3. The benchmark is then filtered to only include those that are associated with the ShARe/CLEF eHealth corpus dataset.
    4. Finally, it retrieves the titles and IDs of the research papers that match these conditions. 

    Please note that the actual query may need to be modified based on the actual structure of the ORKG. 

    Also, the SPARQL query assumes that the entities and properties mentioned in the question are correctly linked in the ORKG.
