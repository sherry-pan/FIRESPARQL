Question:
List the code links in papers that use the GPT-2 (small) model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>

SELECT?p?s?o
WHERE {
 ?s orkgc:Resource orkgc:label "GPT-2 (small)".
 ?s orkgp:hasProperty?p.
 ?p orkgp:P26 orkgp:url "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075".
}
``` 

Note: The provided RDF data dump and the context are not included in this response. The SPARQL query is generated based on the provided input question and the context. 

Please note that the actual RDF data dump and the context might be different from what is provided here. The SPARQL query is generated based on the provided input question and the context. 

Also, please note that the RDF prefixes and the URIs used in the SPARQL query are fictional and for demonstration purposes only. The actual RDF prefixes and URIs might be different in the actual RDF data dump. 

The actual SPARQL query might need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data dump and the context. 

The provided output is based on the assumption that the RDF data dump contains the necessary entities and properties to answer the question.
