Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Macro Recall metric on the NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only) benchmark dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The key entities and properties mentioned are:

1. "model" - This is a general term referring to machine learning models.
2. "Macro Recall" - This is a specific metric used to evaluate model performance.
3. "NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only)" - This is the benchmark dataset in question.

Next, I need to find similar entities or properties in the RDF data. Looking through the context, I see several resources and predicates related to models, datasets, and metrics.

For "model," the RDF data mentions resources like R147652, which is associated with steps involving models and algorithms. There's also R283709 and R283710, which are about papers and methods. These could be related to models used in experiments.

For "Macro Recall," I don't see a direct mention, but there are metrics like "HAS_VALUE" with "93.9" which might indicate performance scores. Predicates like P39020 describe steps involving models and their evaluation, which could relate to performance metrics.

Regarding the dataset "NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only)," the context doesn't explicitly mention it, but there are datasets like "MNIST" and "SVM" mentioned in the steps. These could be similar or related datasets, so I can consider those as candidates.

Now, I'll map these extracted terms to the RDF data. For "model," the relevant URIs are orkgr:R147652, R283709, and R283710. For "Macro Recall," since it's not directly present, I'll look for metrics or performance values, which might be linked via predicates like HAS_VALUE or P5044. The dataset "NLP-TDMS" isn't present, so I'll consider similar datasets mentioned, like MNIST, which is orkgr:R147652.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their corresponding candidates from the RDF data. Each candidate will include the URI, label, and type. Since "Macro Recall" isn't explicitly present, I'll include the closest related predicates and resources that indicate performance metrics.

I need to ensure that the URIs use the correct prefixes: "orkgr:" for resources, "orkgp:" for predicates, and "orkgc:" for classes. Also, each candidate should have the appropriate type, such as "orkgc:Resource" or "orkgc:Dataset."

Finally, I'll format the JSON as specified, grouping the results under each extracted term and listing the top candidates with their details.
