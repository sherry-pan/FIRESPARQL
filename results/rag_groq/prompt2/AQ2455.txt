Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The query is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the XLNet (base) model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of papers or models related to XLNet. The context has two main sections, each describing a resource. 

Looking at the first resource, R147652, it describes a method involving steps for named entity recognition. It mentions models like SVM and datasets like MNIST, but nothing about XLNet. The second resource, R284316, talks about a paper titled "validation research" that uses techniques like Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight. It also mentions models like Flair NER and End-to-End Neural EL, but again, no XLNet.

Since the context doesn't mention XLNet or any papers using it, I can't extract any relevant information. Therefore, the candidates list for both "papers" and "XLNet (base) model" will be empty.

The context provided does not contain any information related to the XLNet model or papers that utilize it. Therefore, no candidates can be extracted or listed.
