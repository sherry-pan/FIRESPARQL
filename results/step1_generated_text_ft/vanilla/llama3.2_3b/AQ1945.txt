    Note: The model and benchmark models used in this example are fictional and for illustration purposes only. In a real-world scenario, you would use the actual model and benchmark models used in the H-NLI model. 

    To answer this question, we will use a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval techniques. 
    Here's an overview of our approach: 
    1. Preprocess the question to extract relevant information. 
    2. Use a knowledge graph database to retrieve relevant information. 
    3. Postprocess the result to generate the SPARQL query. 
    4. Execute the SPARQL query to get the final answer. 
    In this example, we will focus on the postprocessing step to generate the SPARQL query. 
    The goal is to create a query that can be executed on the ORKG to retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 
    To achieve this, we need to identify the key concepts in the question and their relationships. 
    The key concepts in the question are "code links", "papers", "H-NLI model", and "benchmark". 
    The relationships between these concepts are as follows: 
    - A paper can have multiple code links. 
    - A paper can use multiple benchmarks. 
    - A benchmark can have multiple benchmark models. 
    - A benchmark model can be equivalent to another benchmark model. 
    - A benchmark model can use a specific model. 
    - A model can be used by a benchmark model. 
    - A model can be used by a paper. 
    - A code link can be associated with a paper. 
    Using these relationships, we can generate the SPARQL query to retrieve the correct answer. 
    The SPARQL query will query the ORKG to get the papers that use the H-NLI model in any benchmark, and then retrieve the code links associated with these papers. 
    The query will filter the results to get only the first 10 papers. 
    The final answer will be a list of code links in papers that use the H-NLI model in any benchmark. 

    We will use the following variables to represent the key concepts: 
    -?paper: represents a paper 
    -?code: represents a code link 
    -?benchmark: represents a benchmark 
    -?benchmarkModel: represents a benchmark model 
    -?model: represents a model 
    -?hNliModel: represents the H-NLI model 
    -?equivalentModel: represents an equivalent benchmark model
