Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user's question is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the HRLRE model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "papers" and "HRLRE model". The property mentioned is "utilized", which relates papers to the model.

Looking at the context data, I see that there are several resources related to papers, such as R147246 and R283710, which have properties like P27 listing authors and P28 and P29 for volume and year. However, I don't see any direct mention of the HRLRE model in the provided context. 

Since the context doesn't include information about the HRLRE model or any papers that used it, I can't retrieve any specific entities or properties related to it. Therefore, the candidates for both "papers" and "HRLRE model" will be empty in the JSON output.

I need to structure the answer according to the specified format, grouping the results by the extracted terms. Each term should have a list of candidates, but in this case, both lists will be empty because the context lacks the necessary information.

```json
{
  "question": "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the HRLRE model and include the links to their code?",
  "extracted_terms": {
    "papers": [],
    "HRLRE model": [],
    "utilized": []
  },
  "candidates": {
    "papers": [],
    "HRLRE model": [],
    "utilized": []
  }
}
```
