Question:
Name the datasets that have been used for benchmarking in the Image Classification research problem?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?dataset
WHERE {
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset rdfs:label?label.
 ?dataset ora:hasDataset?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
 ?benchmark ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?evaluation a ora:Evaluation.
 ?benchmark ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark a ora:Benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:hasDataset?dataset.
  FILTER (STR(?label) = "Benchmark MPQA")
  FILTER (STR(?label) = "MPQA")
}
```
    You may use the provided context and the SPARQL query to infer additional entities and properties not explicitly mentioned in the question.
    You are allowed to use the provided context to infer additional entities and properties not explicitly mentioned in the question.
    You may assume that the ORKG contains the following entities and properties:
    - orkg:R122689, orkg:R131168, orkg:R147246 are all URIs for different entities in the ORKG.
    - ora:Dataset, ora:ResearchProblem, ora:Evaluation, ora:Benchmark, orkg:Resource, orkg:Resource, orkg:Resource are all RDF types.
    - rdfs:label, hasDataset, hasBenchmark, hasEvaluation, hasBenchmark, hasDataset, hasDataset are all RDF predicates.
    - orkg:R122689, orkg:R131168, orkg:R147246 are all URIs for different entities in the ORKG.
    - orkg:R122689, orkg:R131168, orkg:R147246 are all URIs for different entities in the ORKG.
