Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the PROTEINS dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "PROTEINS")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
      ?paper         orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
       OPTIONAL {?paper      orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
                ?model      rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.}
      ?cont         orkgp:HAS_PAPER         ?paper.
       OPTIONAL {?cont      orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.}
     }
