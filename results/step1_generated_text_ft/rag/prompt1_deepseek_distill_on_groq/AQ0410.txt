Okay, so I have this query where I need to list the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the NYT24 dataset. Let me think about how to approach this using the given ORKG RDF data.

First, I need to extract the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The main terms here are "research papers," "benchmark," and "NYT24 dataset." So, I'm looking for papers that have a benchmark using NYT24.

Looking at the context data, I see several resources labeled as Papers. For example, R211524 is a Paper titled "NNE: A dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire." That sounds relevant because it's about NLP tasks, which often use datasets like NYT24. Another one is R211327, which is also a Paper but the label isn't provided. R175046 is about open access and citations, which might not be directly related, but it's still a Paper.

I also notice R175045, which is a Contribution labeled "Downloads." Not sure if that's relevant, but maybe it's part of a paper that uses NYT24. R175044 is another Paper about the impact of open access, which might not be directly related, but it's worth considering.

Now, I need to calculate cosine similarity between the question and these entities. The question is about benchmarks on NYT24, so I'll look for terms like "benchmark," "NYT24," and "dataset" in the labels. R211524 mentions a dataset, so that's a good match. R175046 and R175044 are about open access, which might not mention benchmarks, but they could be part of studies that use such datasets.

Since the context doesn't explicitly mention "NYT24," I have to infer based on the dataset usage. R211524 is about newswire data, which is similar to NYT24, so it gets a higher score. The others might have lower scores because they don't directly mention benchmarks or the specific dataset.

I'll list the top 5, even though some might not be perfect matches. I'll include their URIs and labels, assigning scores based on relevance. R211524 gets the highest score, followed by others that are Papers but less directly related.

To answer the query, we need to identify research papers that contain benchmarks using the NYT24 dataset. Based on the provided context, here are the top 5 similar entities or properties:
