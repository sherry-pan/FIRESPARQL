Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Name the datasets that have been used for benchmarking in the Image Classification research problem?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities mentioned are "datasets" and "benchmarking" in the context of "Image Classification." So, the extracted terms are "datasets," "benchmarking," and "Image Classification."

Next, I need to find similar entities or properties in the RDF data. Looking through the context, I see mentions of "MNIST" and "SVM" in the steps, which are related to datasets and methods. There's also a mention of "Horizon 2020" and "Knowledge graph," but those might be less relevant here.

I'll focus on the parts where datasets are discussed. The first step mentions seed terms like "SVM" and "MNIST," which are datasets. Then, in the analysis section, it talks about keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition, which might relate to how datasets are used for benchmarking.

I also notice that there are resources like R147652, which describes a method involving MNIST. This suggests that MNIST is a benchmark dataset for image classification. Additionally, the mention of "Graph analytics" and "Named entity recognition" could imply other datasets, but I don't see specific ones listed beyond MNIST.

Since the context doesn't provide more datasets, I'll have to infer based on the information given. MNIST is a well-known dataset for image classification, so it's a strong candidate. Other possible datasets might include CIFAR or ImageNet, but they aren't mentioned here, so I can't include them.

Therefore, the top candidate for datasets used in benchmarking image classification is MNIST. I'll structure the JSON output accordingly, grouping the results under each extracted term and including the relevant URIs and types from the context.
