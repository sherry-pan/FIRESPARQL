Question:
What is the best performing model benchmarking the Supervised: dataset in terms of SemEval 2013 metric?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql

SELECT?model?metric
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:hasBestModel?bestModel.
 ?bestModel orkgr:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgr:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
 ?evaluation orkgr:hasMetric?metric.
  FILTER (?metric rdfs:label "SemEval 2013".
        ?dataset rdfs:label "Supervised: dataset".
        ?model rdfs:label "best performing model" )
}

    Note that the actual answer may require more complex SPARQL queries, but the above query is a good starting point. 

    If the query does not return any results, the answer is "No results found". 

    If the query returns more than one result, the answer is the first result.
