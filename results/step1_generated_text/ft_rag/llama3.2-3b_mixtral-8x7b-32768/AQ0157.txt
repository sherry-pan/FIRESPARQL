Question:
What models are being evaluated on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
       orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION;
         orkgp:P3018?eval.
      ?eval orkgp:HAS_DATASET;
             orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
      ?dataset orkgp:P1001?model.
      ?model orkgp:P1002?model_lbl.
     }
    ```
This question was automatically generated and may require some modifications to be used in a real-world context. The provided context information may need to be adjusted or expanded to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG. The SPARQL query generated from the question may not be the only possible query, and it may need to be refined or modified to obtain accurate results.
The SPARQL query provided here is the output from the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) semantic search engine. It is designed to retrieve scholarly contributions that match a given natural language question. The query is generated based on the provided context information and the input question.
The query works as follows:
1. It selects the models and their labels from the dataset.
2. It filters the results to only include the models that have been evaluated on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset.
3. It retrieves the labels of the selected models.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the query:

- `SELECT?model?model_lbl`: This line selects the models and their labels from the dataset.
- `WHERE {... }`: This is the main part of the query, where the logic for retrieving the data is defined.
- `orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION; orkgp:P3018?eval.`: This line filters the results to only include the models that have been evaluated on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset. The `HAS_EVALUATION` predicate is used to filter the results, and the `P3018` property is used to link the evaluations to the models.
- `?eval orkgp:HAS_DATASET; orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.`: This line further filters the results to only include the models that have been evaluated on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset. The `HAS_DATASET` predicate is used to filter the results, and the `P1001` property is used to link the datasets to the models.
- `?dataset orkgp:P1002?model.`: This line retrieves the labels of the selected models. The `P1002` property is used to link the models to their labels.
- `?model orkgp:P1002?model_lbl.`: This line retrieves the labels of the
