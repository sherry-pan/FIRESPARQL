Question:
Can you list benchmarked problems in the area of Artificial Intelligence?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?problem?problem_lbl
WHERE {
 ?cont       a            orkgc:Contribution;
              rdfs:label  ?cont_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?cont_lbl) = "benchmarked")
 ?cont       orkgp:P32   ?problem.
 ?problem    rdfs:label   ?problem_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?problem_lbl)
LIMIT 5;
``` 
    Please note that you may need to adjust the query based on the actual structure of your data. This query assumes that the data is in the standard ORKG format. If your data is different, you may need to modify the query accordingly.<|eot_id|>
