Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paperID
    WHERE {
     ?paper       orkgc:HAS_DATASET       orkgc:Dataset;
                  orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK   ?benchmark.
      FILTER (str(?benchmark) = "Penn Treebank (Character Level)")
     ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_PAPER      ?paper.
      OPTIONAL {?paper          orkgp:ID             ?paperID.}
    }<|eot_id|>
