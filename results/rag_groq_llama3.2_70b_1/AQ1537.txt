To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined:

1. **Extract entities and properties from the question**: The key entities and properties mentioned in the question are "top performing model," "Number of params score," and "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset."

2. **Retrieve similar entities or properties from the RDF data dump**: Since the provided RDF data dump does not directly contain information about "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset" or explicit "Number of params score" in the context of a "top performing model," we will have to infer based on available information. The RDF data mentions various resources, including papers, evaluations, and benchmarks, but does not directly answer the question. However, we can look for entities related to evaluations and benchmarks that might imply performance metrics.

3. **Calculate cosine similarity scores**: Given the nature of the task, we would typically calculate cosine similarity between the vector representations of the question and the potential answers. However, without explicit vector representations or a method to generate them from the provided RDF data, we'll proceed conceptually.

Based on the provided RDF data, some relevant entities could be:
- **R134745**: An evaluation with a label "Evaluation Number of params_185.9M", which could be related to the "Number of params score."
- **R134742**: An evaluation with a label "Evaluation Top 1 Accuracy_86.1%", which could imply a performance metric, though not directly "Number of params score."
- **R134746**: Another evaluation with a label "Evaluation Top 1 Accuracy_85.8%", similar to R134742.
- **R134744**: A benchmark with the label "Benchmark ImageNet", which is not directly related to the "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset" but is a benchmark.
- **R212134**: An evaluation, which could be relevant in a broader sense of evaluating models.

Given the lack of direct information about the "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset" and the need for a "top performing model" based on "Number of params score," the task becomes somewhat abstract. Normally, we would calculate cosine similarity scores between the question's vector representation and these entities' vector representations. However, without the ability to generate these vectors from the provided data or a predefined method for doing so, we must acknowledge the limitation.

For the purpose of providing an answer in the requested format, let's assume a hypothetical scenario where we could calculate these similarities, focusing on entities that could be related to evaluations or benchmarks:

```json
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R134745",
    "label": "Evaluation Number of params_185.9M",
    "score": 0.8
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R134742",
    "label": "Evaluation Top 1 Accuracy_86.1%",
    "score": 0.7
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R134746",
    "label": "Evaluation Top 1 Accuracy_85.8%",
    "score": 0.6
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R134744",
    "label": "Benchmark ImageNet",
    "score": 0.4
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R212134",
    "label": "Evaluation",
    "score": 0.3
  }
]
```

Please note, the scores provided are hypothetical and based on an assumption of how these entities might relate to the question, given the information provided in the RDF data dump. In a real-world scenario, calculating these scores would require a more sophisticated approach, including natural language processing techniques to vectorize the question and the entities, and then calculating the cosine similarity between these vectors.
