Okay, so I need to figure out the emergency type of the AMBER Alert. Let me start by understanding what an AMBER Alert is. From what I know, AMBER Alerts are issued when a child is missing and believed to be in imminent danger. They're usually broadcast on radio and TV to help locate the child quickly.

Now, looking at the context provided, I see a lot of RDF data. It mentions various resources and predicates, but I'm not sure if any of them relate to AMBER Alerts. The context talks about methods, datasets, and some entities like SVM and MNIST, which are related to machine learning, not emergencies.

I should check if there's any mention of emergency types or alerts in the context. Scanning through the triples, I see terms like "named entity recognition," "knowledge graph," and "Horizon 2021." There's also a mention of "public deliversables" and "funded projects," but nothing about AMBER Alerts or emergency types.

Since the context doesn't have any information about AMBER Alerts, I can't extract relevant terms or find similar entities from the provided data. The context is focused on research methods and data analysis, not on specific emergency alert systems.

Therefore, based on the given context, there's no information available to determine the emergency type of an AMBER Alert. The answer would require external knowledge beyond what's provided here.

The context provided does not contain information related to AMBER Alerts or their emergency types. The data focuses on research methods, datasets, and entities related to machine learning and knowledge graphs, with no mention of emergency systems or alerts. Therefore, it's not possible to determine the emergency type of an AMBER Alert from the given context.
