Question:
Can you list the metrics used to evaluate models on the BUCC Russian-to-English dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/orkgp#>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/orkgc#>
    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
    PREFIX ork: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/ork#>

    SELECT?metric
    WHERE {
     ?metric orkgc:isEvaluationMetricOf?dataset.
     ?dataset orkgc:hasDataset?datasetName.
     ?datasetName orkgc:datasetName "BUCC Russian-to-English dataset".
     ?metric orkgc:evaluateModelOn?model.
     ?model orkgc:isModelFor?dataset.
    }
    ```
``` 
    If you want to use this query in a SPARQL endpoint, please replace the `http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/orkgp#` and `http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/orkgc#` prefixes with the actual prefixes used by your SPARQL endpoint. 

    The SPARQL query is based on the provided context data. It queries the ORKG RDF data dump to find the metrics used to evaluate models on the BUCC Russian-to-English dataset. The query uses the `isEvaluationMetricOf` and `evaluateModelOn` properties to link metrics to the dataset and models, respectively. The `hasDataset` property is used to filter models that are for the specified dataset. The `datasetName` property is used to filter the dataset to the correct one. 

    Please note that the actual performance of the query may depend on the structure and content of the ORKG RDF data dump.
