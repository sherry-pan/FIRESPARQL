Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the EfficientNetV2-L model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>

    SELECT?paper?code
    WHERE {
     ?paper orkgc:contains?paper orkg:R123456.
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?has_paper.
     ?has_paper orkgp:HAS_MODEL orkgc:Resource "EfficientNetV2-L model".
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
      FILTER (STRLIKE(?code, "EfficientNetV2-L"))
    }
    ``` 

Note: The SPARQL query should be able to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question. The query should also be able to handle the context provided. 

This is not a problem that can be solved with a simple code change. The solution is in the provided SPARQL query. The query is already correct. 

However, I will provide the response as requested. 

The final answer is: 

```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>

SELECT?paper?code
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgc:contains?paper orkg:R123456.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?has_paper.
 ?has_paper orkgp:HAS_MODEL orkgc:Resource "EfficientNetV2-L model".
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
  FILTER (STRLIKE(?code, "EfficientNetV2-L"))
}
``` 

Note: The actual URIs in the query may need to be replaced with the actual URIs from the ORKG. The example
