Okay, so I need to figure out which model has the highest SUCCESS score on the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std benchmark dataset. Let me start by breaking down the question to understand what exactly is being asked.

First, the question is about models and their performance on a specific benchmark dataset. The key terms here are "model," "SUCCESS score," and "Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std benchmark dataset." My task is to find the model with the highest SUCCESS score on this particular dataset.

Looking at the provided context, I see that there are several RDF triples that might be relevant. The context includes information about different resources, their properties, and some metrics. For example, there's a resource R147652 that describes a method involving steps like term expansion and named entity recognition. There's also R147244 with a value of "93.9," which could be a performance metric.

I need to extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities are "model" and "Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std benchmark dataset." The property here is "SUCCESS score." So, I should look for these terms in the context.

In the context, I see that R147244 has a HAS_VALUE of "93.9." This could be a SUCCESS score. The resource R147652 is linked to this value, so it might be the model in question. Additionally, R283709 and R283710 describe other resources, possibly other models or papers, but they don't mention the SUCCESS score.

I should check if there are any other resources with similar properties. However, from the given context, R147652 seems to be the only one with a high value linked to a method that could be a model. The steps described in R147652 involve expanding seed terms and using a CRF algorithm, which sounds like a named entity recognition model.

So, putting it together, the model associated with R147652 has a SUCCESS score of 93.9 on the benchmark dataset. Since the question asks for the highest, and this is the only score provided, it must be the top model.

I should structure the answer to include the extracted terms and the top candidates. The model URI is R147652, and it's linked to the SUCCESS score of 93.9. There might be other models, but without more data, this is the most relevant one.
