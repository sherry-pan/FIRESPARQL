Question:
Which model has achieved the highest BLEU score score on the WMT2014 English-German benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?score
WHERE {
 ?model orkgr:BLEU_score?score.
  FILTER (STR(?score) = "93.9").
 ?model orkgr:WMT2014_English_German_benchmark?dataset.
  FILTER (STR(?dataset) = "WMT2014").
}
``` 

Note: The SPARQL query is based on the provided context and the extracted terms. The query is designed to retrieve the model with the highest BLEU score on the WMT2014 English-German benchmark dataset. The `FILTER` clause is used to match the score and dataset URIs. The query returns the model URI and score for the matching resources. 

Please note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the specific structure and data of the ORKG. 

Also, note that the `orkgr` and `orkgp` prefixes are assumed to be defined in the ORKG, and the `orkgc` prefix is used to represent the `Resource` type. 

The `SELECT` clause retrieves the `model` and `score` URIs. The `WHERE` clause filters the results based on the score and dataset URIs. The `FILTER` clause is used to match the score and dataset URIs. 

The query returns the model URI and score for the matching resources.
