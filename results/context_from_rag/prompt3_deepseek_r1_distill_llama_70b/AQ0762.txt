Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the WMT2014 French-English dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "evaluation metrics" and "WMT2014 French-English dataset". The property mentioned is "benchmarking models on".

Next, I'll look through the context information to find similar entities and properties. From the context, I see that there are resources related to benchmarking, datasets, and evaluation. For example, R147652 describes a benchmarking process with steps, which might relate to evaluation metrics. R283709 and R283710 discuss various methods and datasets, including keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition, which might use specific metrics.

I'll also look for properties that relate to evaluation, like HAS_VALUE or P39020, which describe steps or metrics. Additionally, I'll check for any mentions of specific datasets like WMT2014, but I don't see it explicitly. However, R283709 mentions "Benchmark" and "Dataset" types, which could be relevant.

Now, I'll compile the top candidates for each extracted term. For "evaluation metrics", I'll include resources that discuss benchmarking steps or have values associated with them. For "WMT2014 French-English dataset", since it's not explicitly mentioned, I'll look for similar datasets or benchmark resources. The property "benchmarking models on" can be linked to predicates like P39020 or HAS_VALUE.

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their corresponding candidates, ensuring the URIs use the correct prefixes and include types where applicable.
