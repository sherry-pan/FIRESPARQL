Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the RotoWire dataset for relation generation. 

First, I'll look through the context information. The context has two main sections, each containing RDF data. I'll examine each section to find relevant papers and their details.

Looking at the first section, I see a resource R147652 which describes a method involving steps for NER. It mentions using datasets like MNIST, but not RotoWire. The authors listed are Ligia Sierra, Betty L LÃ³pez, Flavio Forni, Maria Angela Vandelli, Michele Zoli, and Antonietta Vilella. The publication year is 2015, volume 6, and it's associated with resource R147244 which has a value of 93.9, possibly an accuracy or F1 score.

The second section discusses resource R284316, which is about extracting entity knowledge using a model called jpark. It mentions datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP, but not RotoWire. The authors here are Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta, published in 2021, volume 11. The DOI is provided as 10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075.

Since neither section explicitly mentions the RotoWire dataset, I need to consider if any of the mentioned datasets are related or if there's an implicit connection. However, the context doesn't link these papers to RotoWire. 

Therefore, based on the provided data, there are no papers that have performed benchmarks on the RotoWire dataset. The answer should reflect that no relevant papers were found in the context.
