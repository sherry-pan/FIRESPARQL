Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the CAIT-XS-36 model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://orkgr.org/resource/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://orkgc.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkgp.org/predicate/>
SELECT?p?o
WHERE {
 ?p a orkgc:Resource.
 ?p orkgr:CAIT-XS-36_model.
 ?p orkgc:has_paper.
 ?o a orkgc:Paper.
 ?o orkgr:DOI "10.1002/ora.2023.123456789".
 ?p orkgp:has_code_link.
 ?o orkgp:url "https://example.com/cait-xs-36-code".
}
``` 
    The SPARQL query is designed to query the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) for papers that benchmark the CAIT-XS-36 model and provide code links to the papers. The query uses the `orkgr:CAIT-XS-36_model` URI to filter resources related to the model, and then joins this with resources that have papers and code links. The query also filters for papers with a specific DOI and code link URL. The query is designed to return the papers and code links that match the input question.<|eot_id|>
