Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Dmlab-30 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Dmlab-30")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:P32               ?paper.
      ?cont         orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark;
                     orkgp:P31               ?paper.
      ?paper        rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
      }<|eot_id|>
