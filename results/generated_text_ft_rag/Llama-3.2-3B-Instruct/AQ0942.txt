Question:
Can you list the metrics used to evaluate models on the Atari 2600 Freeway dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?metric
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Freeway")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                  orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
  OPTIONAL {?eval           orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.}
}
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT?metric
WHERE {
 ?model      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION     ?eval.
 ?eval        orkgp:HAS_DATASET        ?dataset;
               orkgp:HAS_METRIC         ?metric.
 ?dataset    rdfs:label                ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Freeway")
}
