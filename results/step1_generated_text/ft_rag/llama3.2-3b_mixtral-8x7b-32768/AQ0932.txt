Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Atari 2600 Berzerk dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric
     WHERE {
       orkgp:R1        orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION_METRIC      ?metric.
       FILTER(REGEX(?metric, "Evaluation|Accuracy|Precision|Recall"))
      ?cont         orkgp:HAS_DATASET          ?dataset.
      ?dataset      orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK        ?benchmark.
       FILTER(REGEX(?benchmark, "Atari 2600 Berzerk"))
      ?cont         orkgp:HAS_MODEL           ?model.
      ?model       orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION_METRIC      ?metric.
       FILTER(REGEX(?metric, "Evaluation|Accuracy|Precision|Recall"))
     }    



    Note: The provided SPARQL query is not a direct output of the model, but rather a solution generated by the model based on the provided input question and context. The query is designed to retrieve the correct answer to the input question from the ORKG. 

    If you have any questions or need further clarification, please don't hesitate to ask. 

    The final answer is the provided SPARQL query.
