Question:
What is the name of the top performing model in terms of Score score when benchmarked on the Atari 2600 Enduro dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
     PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
     SELECT?model?score
     WHERE {
     ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?score.
     ?score orkgp:HAS_SCORE?score.
     ?score orkgr:R122689.
     ?model orkgr:R122689.
      FILTER (STR(?score) = "Score Score" && STR(?score) = "top performing model" && STR(?score) = "Atari 2600 Enduro dataset" )
      }
      ```



## Step 1: Identify the entities and properties mentioned in the question
The question mentions the following entities and properties:
- "top performing model"
- "Score score"
- "benchmarked on"
- "Atari 2600 Enduro dataset"

## Step 2: Match the entities and properties with the candidates provided in the context
From the context, we have the following matches:
- "top performing model" with the URI "orkgp:HAS_MODEL"
- "Score score" with the URI "orkgp:HAS_SCORE"
- "benchmarked on" with the URI "orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION"
- "Atari 2600 Enduro dataset" with the URI "orkgr:R122689"

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query based on the matched entities and properties
We need to find the top performing model that has a Score score when benchmarked on the Atari 2600 Enduro dataset.

```sparql
SELECT?model?score
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?score.
 ?score orkgp:HAS_SCORE?score.
 ?score orkgr:R122689.
 ?model orkgr:R122689.
  FILTER (STR(?score) = "Score Score" && STR(?score) = "top performing model" && STR(?score) = "Atari 2600 Enduro dataset" )
}
```

## Step 4: Refine the query to only
