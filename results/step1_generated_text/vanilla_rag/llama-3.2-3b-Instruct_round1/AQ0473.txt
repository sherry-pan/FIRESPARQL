Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Rotowire (Content Selection) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:has_benchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:has_dataset <http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/URI#Rotowire_(ContentSelection)>.
    ?benchmark orkg:has_evaluation?evaluation.
    ?paper orkg:has_title?title.
    ?paper orkg:has_method?method.
    ?paper orkg:has_id?id.
     }<|eot_id|>
