Question:
What are the most commonly used benchmark datasets for the Joint Entity and Relation Extraction research field?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc/>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

    SELECT?dataset?benchmark
    WHERE {
     ?dataset a orkg:Dataset.
     ?dataset orkp:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
     ?benchmark a orkc:Benchmark.
     ?dataset orkgp:hasResearchField?researchField.
     ?researchField a orkg:ResearchField.
     ?researchField orkgp:hasResearchField "Joint Entity and Relation Extraction".
     ?benchmark orkgp:hasDataset "Benchmark MPQA".
      FILTER (STR(?benchmark) = "Benchmark MPQA")
    }
    ``` 
    Note: The provided SPARQL query is already partially generated based on the context provided. The goal is to complete the query to retrieve the most commonly used benchmark datasets for the Joint Entity and Relation Extraction research field. 

    You are required to complete the SPARQL query to get the correct answer to the input question. 

    You can use the provided context to guide your completion of the query. 

    Assume that the ORKG contains the following entities and properties:
    - orkg:Dataset
    - orkc:Benchmark
    - orkp:hasBenchmark
    - orkgp:hasResearchField
    - orkg:ResearchField
    - orkgp:hasResearchField
    - orkgp:hasDataset

    You can use the provided context to infer the relationships between the entities and properties mentioned in the question. 

    You can also assume that the most commonly used benchmark datasets for the Joint Entity and Relation Extraction research field are "MPQA" and "Benchmark MPQA".

    Please complete the SPARQL query to retrieve the correct answer. 

    You can use the provided context to guide your completion of the query. 

    The completed SPARQL query should be in the format of the provided query, without any additional free text or explanations.
