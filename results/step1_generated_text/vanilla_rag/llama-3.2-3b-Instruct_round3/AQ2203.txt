Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the 6-layer QRNN model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?paper?paperHasBenchmark?benchmark?paperHasImplementation 
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:HAS_METHOD "6-layer QRNN model".
    ?paper orkg:HAS_IMPLEMENTATION?implementation.
     FILTER (strcontains(STR(?implementation), "code reference") || strcontains(STR(?implementation), "benchmark"))
     }<|eot_id|>
