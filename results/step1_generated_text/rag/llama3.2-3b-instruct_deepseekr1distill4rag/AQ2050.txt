Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the MMV TSM-50x2 model and include the links to their code?

 ?paper orkp:has_code?code.
  FILTER (?model = <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/orkg#MMV_TSM-50x2_model>)
}
```    Note: The SPARQL query is in the format expected by the ORKG. It assumes that the context data is stored in the ORKG, with the specified URIs and labels. The query uses the `has_model` and `has_code` properties to link papers to models and code links, respectively. The `FILTER` clause is used to restrict the results to only those papers that have the MMV TSM-50x2 model. Since there is no information about the MMV TSM-50x2 model in the context, the query will not return any results.<|eot_id|>
