Okay, so I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the QNLI dataset. The question is about metrics used, so I'm thinking about what kind of evaluation metrics are common in NLP tasks, especially for datasets like QNLI, which is a natural language inference task.

Looking at the JSON example, I see properties like "evaluation", "method", "approach", etc. But wait, the actual context provided has a lot more properties. Let me go through them one by one.

First, I see properties related to evaluation, like "hasEvaluation" which seems directly relevant because it's about evaluation metrics. Then there's "Accuracy", "Recall", "macro-F1", "micro-F1" â€“ these are all common metrics used to evaluate model performance. 

I also notice "NDCG@10", which is a ranking metric, but I'm not sure if it's used for QNLI. Maybe, but perhaps more relevant for information retrieval tasks. 

There are properties like "data splitting method" and "validation set" which are about how the data is handled, but not directly metrics. "Knowledge graph name" and "using an ontology" seem more about the data structure than evaluation.

Properties like "Avg Characters", "Avg words", etc., are about data statistics, not evaluation metrics. 

So, focusing on the ones that are clearly metrics: Accuracy, Recall, macro-F1, micro-F1, and hasEvaluation. These would help in determining the performance of models on the QNLI dataset.

The most relevant properties from the JSON file that correspond to evaluating models on the QNLI dataset are those related to evaluation metrics. These include Accuracy, Recall, macro-F1, micro-F1, and hasEvaluation. These properties are directly associated with assessing model performance, making them suitable for understanding the evaluation process of the QNLI dataset.

    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71081",

    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71080",
    "label": "micro-F1",
    "reason": "Micro-F1 score provides a balanced measure of precision and recall."

    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71075",
    "label": "hasEvaluation",
    "reason": "This property indicates the presence of evaluation metrics."
  }
