Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given context. The query is asking for a list of papers that used the Prior noop model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information provided. The context has several RDF triples from an ORKG dump. Each triple has a subject, predicate, and object. The subjects are URIs like http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R76234, and the predicates include things like rdf:type and rdfs:label.

I need to extract entities and properties mentioned in the question. The question is about papers using the "Prior noop model" and their code links. So, the key entities here are "papers" and "Prior noop model," and the property would be something like "links to their code."

Looking through the context, I see several resources labeled as "Paper" or "Contribution." For example, R75841 is a Paper with the label "Factors influencing evidence-based decision-making in humanitarian response." R162991 is another Paper titled "Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study." 

I also notice that some resources are labeled as "Contribution," like R75431 and R162993, both labeled "Contribution 1." There's a Venue labeled "IBM Journal of Research and Development" at R75430, and another Venue at R162992 labeled "Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing."

Now, I need to find which of these papers used the "Prior noop model." However, scanning through the context, I don't see any mention of "Prior noop model" or any related terms. The context provided doesn't include any information about specific models used in the papers listed. 

Since the context doesn't have the necessary information about the Prior noop model, I can't retrieve any relevant papers that used it. Therefore, the top similar entities or properties based on the given data would be the papers and contributions listed, but none of them are related to the Prior noop model.

So, the answer would be an empty list because there's no matching data in the provided context.

To address the query, we need to identify papers that utilized the "Prior noop model" and include links to their code. However, upon examining the provided context, there is no mention of the "Prior noop model" or any related terms. The context includes various papers and contributions but lacks the specific information required. Therefore, the result is an empty list as no relevant data is found.
