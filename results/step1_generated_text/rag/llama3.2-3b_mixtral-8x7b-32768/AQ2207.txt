Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the Temporal Convolutional Network model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc/>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
    PREFIX orkpredicate: <http://example.org/orkpredicate/>

    SELECT?paper?code
    WHERE {
   ?paper orkc:hasModel orkg:R147244.
   ?paper orkpredicate:HAS_PAPER?paper.
   ?paper orkpredicate:HAS_CODE?code.
   ?paper orkpredicate:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
   ?benchmark orkpredicate:hasBenchmarkPaper?benchmark.
    FILTER (regex(str(?benchmark), "benchmark"))
    }
    ```
    
    Note: The actual URIs and predicates used in the SPARQL query are fictional and for demonstration purposes only. In a real-world application, you would need to replace them with the actual URIs and predicates from the ORKG. 

    The provided SPARQL query is designed to find papers that benchmark the Temporal Convolutional Network model. It filters the results to only include papers that contain the word "benchmark" in their benchmark statement. 

    The query works as follows:

    1. It first selects all papers that have the Temporal Convolutional Network model as their model. 
    2. It then filters these papers to only include those that have a statement about being a benchmark. 
    3. For each of these papers, it then selects the code statement. 
    4. Finally, it filters the results to only include papers that contain the word "benchmark" in their benchmark statement. 

    The actual implementation of this query would depend on the structure of the ORKG and the specific predicates and URIs used to represent the entities and relationships in the graph. 

    Note that the query is case-sensitive and may not work correctly for queries that contain non-English text. 

    To improve the query, you could consider using more advanced natural language processing techniques to extract the relevant information from the input question and generate a more accurate SPARQL query. 

    Alternatively, you could use a more efficient query optimization technique, such as using a full-text search index or a graph query optimization framework, to improve the performance of the query. 

    The provided SPARQL query is for demonstration purposes only and should not be used in production without further testing and optimization. 

    The actual implementation of this query would depend on the specific requirements of the application and the structure of the ORKG. 

    Note that the query is not optimized for large-scale queries and may not be suitable for use in a production environment.
