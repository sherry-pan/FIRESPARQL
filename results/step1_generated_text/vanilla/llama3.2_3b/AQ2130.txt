    Note: The first query is not correct and the second one is. The first one does not filter the papers by the link to the code, and the second one does. The first query returns a list of papers that have utilized the Large mLSTM model but does not include the link to their code, and the second query returns a list of papers that have utilized the Large mLSTM model and includes the link to their code. 
    Note: The second query is a combination of the first query and the query to get the link to the code. 
    Note: The second query is the correct query to get the list of papers that have utilized the Large mLSTM model and includes the link to their code.
