Question:
What is the best performing model benchmarking the AESLC dataset in terms of ROUGE-1 metric?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl (MAX(?metric) AS?metric_lbl) 
     WHERE {
         orkgp:R168475 orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
         FILTER (str(?dataset rdfs:label) = "AESLC")
        ?dataset orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.
        ?metric orkgp:HAS_MODEL          ?model.
         ORDER BY DESC(?metric)
        ?model rdfs:label                ?model_lbl.
     }
     LIMIT 1. 
    If the question is "What is the best performing model in terms of ROUGE-1 metric?", the query is
    SELECT?model?model_lbl (MAX(?metric) AS?metric_lbl) 
    WHERE {
         orkgp:R168475 orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
         FILTER (str(?dataset rdfs:label) = "AESLC")
        ?dataset orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.
        ?metric orkgp:HAS_MODEL          ?model.
         ORDER BY DESC(?metric)
        ?model rdfs:label                ?model_lbl.
     }
     LIMIT 1. 

    Please note that the above queries are the same because the 'best performing model' is a subjective 
    interpretation of the data and the ordering of the results by the ROUGE-1 metric is not guaranteed.
    The actual best performing model may be different from the model that is reported as the best performing 
    model in the results of the query. 
    If the question is "What is the ROUGE-1 metric used in the benchmarking of the AESLC dataset?", the query is
    SELECT?metric?metric_lbl
    WHERE {
         orkgp:R168475 orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
         FILTER (str(?dataset rdfs:label) = "AESLC")
        ?dataset orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.
        ?metric orkgp:HAS_METRIC          ?metric_lbl.
     }
    LIMIT 1.
    Note that the above queries are the same because the 'ROUGE-1 metric' is a property, not a value. 
    Therefore, the same query can be used to retrieve the ROUGE-1 metric and the value of the ROUGE-1 metric.
    The actual ROUGE-1 metric used in the benchmarking of the AESLC dataset may be different from the value 
    reported in the results of the query. 

    Here is the correct SPARQL query for the given question: 
    SELECT?model?model_lbl (MAX(?metric) AS?metric_lbl) 
    WHERE {
