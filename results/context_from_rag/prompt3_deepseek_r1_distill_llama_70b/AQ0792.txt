Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Quasart-T benchmark dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "metrics" and "Quasart-T benchmark dataset". The property mentioned is "used to evaluate". So, I'm looking for metrics related to evaluating models on this specific dataset.

Next, I'll look through the context information to find similar entities and properties. From the context, I see that there are various resources and predicates related to evaluation, models, and datasets. For example, there's a resource R147652 which has steps involving evaluation, and another resource R283709 which mentions "Graph analytics" and "Named entity recognition". 

I also notice that the predicates like P39020 describe steps, and there are mentions of specific metrics like "HAS_VALUE" with "93.9". However, I'm not seeing a direct mention of "Quasart-T" or specific metrics used for it. 

Since the exact dataset isn't present, I'll have to infer based on similar datasets and their associated metrics. For instance, if "Quasart-T" is similar to other benchmarks like "MPQA", I can look for metrics used there. In the example provided, metrics like accuracy, F1-score, and precision are common.

Looking at the context, I see that R147652 involves steps where models are evaluated using a CRF algorithm, which might relate to metrics like F1-score. Also, R283709 mentions "Named entity recognition", which often uses precision, recall, and F1-score as metrics.

I'll compile a list of possible metrics that are commonly used in evaluating models on benchmark datasets, even if they aren't explicitly linked to Quasart-T in the provided data. These might include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, etc.

Finally, I'll structure the answer in the required JSON format, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including the top candidates for each. Since the exact dataset isn't found, I'll note that the metrics are inferred based on similar datasets.
