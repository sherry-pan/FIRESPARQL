Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Prior noop model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?code
WHERE {
 ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
            rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "Prior noop")
 ?model      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?dataset    orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
}
```    end of codeblock
```

Note: The provided codeblock contains a SPARQL query that can be used to retrieve the desired information from the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). The query is designed to find papers that utilize the "Prior noop model" and include links to their code. However, as the provided context lacks the necessary information about the Prior noop model, the query will not return any relevant results. Therefore, the output of the query will be an empty list.<|eot_id|>
