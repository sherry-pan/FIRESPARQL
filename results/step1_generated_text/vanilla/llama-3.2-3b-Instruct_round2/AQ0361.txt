Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the SciERC dataset?

WHERE {
 ?paper a dbo:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper dbo:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark dbo:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset dbo:datasetName "SciERC".
  SERVICE dfn:search 
  { bd:service <http://linked.data.gov.uk/ontology/dfn/search>. }
