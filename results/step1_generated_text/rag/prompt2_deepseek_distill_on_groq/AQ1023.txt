Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Can you list the metrics used to evaluate models on the MUTAG dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "models" and "MUTAG dataset". The property being asked about is "metrics used to evaluate". So, I need to look for these in the context.

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 has steps that mention models like SVM and datasets like MNIST. There's also information about evaluation, like in R147244 which has a value of "93.9", possibly an accuracy score. Another resource, R284316, talks about techniques and evaluation methods, mentioning metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

I need to find terms related to evaluation metrics. From R284316, the abstract mentions "precision", "recall", and "F1-score". These are common evaluation metrics. Also, R147652's steps mention using a CRF algorithm, which might relate to model performance metrics.

Next, I'll compute the similarity between the extracted terms and the entities in the context. "MUTAG dataset" isn't directly mentioned, but "MNIST" is. Since both are datasets, they might be similar. For "models", terms like "SVM" and "NERC" come to mind. For "metrics", "precision", "recall", and "F1-score" are relevant.

Now, I'll select the top candidates. For "MUTAG dataset", the closest is "MNIST" from R147652. For "models", "SVM" is a good match. For "metrics", "precision", "recall", and "F1-score" from R284316 are the top choices.

I'll structure the JSON output as specified, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including their URIs, labels, scores, types, and RDF types. I'll make sure to use the correct prefixes for URIs and include the necessary types like "orkgc:Resource" and "orkgp:Predicate".

I think that's all. Now, I'll put it together in the required JSON format.
