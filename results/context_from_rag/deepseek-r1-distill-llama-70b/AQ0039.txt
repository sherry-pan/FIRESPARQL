Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to answering the question about models tested on the refsQ17 benchmark dataset. 

First, the question is asking for a list of models that have been tested on a specific benchmark dataset. So, I should look for properties related to benchmarks, datasets, and models.

Looking through the JSON, I see properties like "has benchmark" and "has dataset". These seem directly related because they likely link to the specific dataset mentioned. 

Next, the question is about models, so properties like "method" or "approach" might be relevant since they often describe the models or methods used. 

I also notice properties like "evaluation" and "implementation", which could provide information on how the models were tested and what they were implemented with. 

Additionally, "has implementation" might link to the actual models used, which is exactly what the question is asking for. 

I should make sure each selected property clearly connects to either the benchmark, the dataset, or the models themselves. This way, the answer will cover all aspects of the question comprehensively.

To answer the question about models tested on the refsQ17 benchmark dataset, the relevant properties from the JSON file are:

1. **has benchmark**: Directly relates to benchmark datasets, indicating which models were tested on specific benchmarks.
2. **has dataset**: Connects to the dataset in question, helping identify models associated with it.
3. **method**: Describes the models or approaches used, which are tested on the dataset.
4. **evaluation**: Provides information on how the models were assessed using the dataset.
5. **implementation**: Links to the actual models implemented and tested.

These properties collectively cover the necessary aspects to determine which models were evaluated on the specified benchmark dataset.

**Answer:**
