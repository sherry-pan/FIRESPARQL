Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the AcrE model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?paperCode
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:Paper.
 ?paper ora:UtilizedBy?model.
 ?model ora:AcreModel.
 ?paper ora:HasCode?paperCode.
}
``` 
    Note: The sparql query is not complete and needs to be further extended based on the actual data in the Open Research Knowledge Graph. 

    The sparql query above only retrieves the papers that have utilized the AcrE model and include the links to their code. However, it does not cover all possible cases that might be included in the ORKG, for example, it only considers the "UtilizedBy" and "HasCode" predicates. It is recommended to extend the sparql query to cover all the necessary predicates and cases.

    For example, you can extend the sparql query to include the "Utilizes" predicate to get the model that the paper utilizes, and the "HasLink" predicate to get the links to the code. 

    Here is an example of how you can extend the sparql query:
    ```sparql
SELECT?paper?paperCode?model?link
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:Paper.
 ?paper ora:Utilizes?model.
 ?model ora:AcreModel.
 ?paper ora:HasCode?paperCode.
 ?paper ora:HasLink?link.
}
``` 

    This extended sparql query retrieves the papers that have utilized the AcrE model, include the links to their code, and also includes the model that the paper utilizes and the links to the code. 

    Note that the actual sparql query may need to be further extended or modified based on the actual data in the ORKG. 

    Please see below for the final answer.
    ```
    SELECT?paper?paperCode?model?link
    WHERE {
     ?paper a ora:Paper.
     ?paper ora:Utilizes?model.
     ?model ora:AcreModel.
     ?paper ora:HasCode?paperCode.
     ?paper ora:HasLink?link.
    }
    ``` 
    Note: The final answer is based on the provided context and the extended sparql query. It is recommended to further extend the sparql query to cover all the necessary predicates and cases based on the actual data in the ORKG. 

    The final answer is not a number, but a sparql query that can be executed on the ORKG to retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 

    Please note that the sparql query is not a machine learning
