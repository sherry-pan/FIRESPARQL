Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Duel hs model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
      ?model        a            orkgc:Model;
                   rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "Duel HS")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                       orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(?model_lbl labels?model_lbl)
``` 

    The code is not included in the provided context, so it cannot be retrieved. 

    Note: The provided context does not contain any information related to the "Duel HS model" or papers that utilize it. Therefore, there are no relevant entities or properties to retrieve. 

    The SPARQL query provided above is designed to query the ORKG and retrieve the source code for papers that utilize the Duel HS model. However, since the Duel HS model is not mentioned in the context, the query will not return any results. 

    The output of the query is an empty list, as there are no relevant entities or properties to retrieve. 

    The SPARQL query uses the following variables and predicates:

    *   `?model`: represents the model used in the papers.
    *   `?model_lbl`: represents the label of the model.
    *   `?benchmark`: represents the benchmark used in the papers.
    *   `?cont`: represents the contribution or comparison.
    *   `?code`: represents the source code.
    *   `str(?model_lbl) = "Duel HS"`: filters the results to only include papers that use the Duel HS model.
    *   `?cont orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model`: filters the results to only include papers that use the Duel HS model.
    *   `?cont orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE?code`: retrieves the source code for the papers that use the Duel HS model.
    *   `ORDER BY DESC(?model_lbl labels?model_lbl)`: sorts the results in descending order based on the model label.
