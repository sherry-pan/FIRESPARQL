Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Pearson Correlation metric on the MedSTS benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT?model?metric
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:has_model?m.
 ?m orkgp:has_metric?metric.
 ?model ork:relatedTo?m.
 ?m ork:relatedTo?d.
 ?d orkgc:Resource?m.
 ?d orkgc:Dataset?m.
  FILTER (STR(?metric) = "Pearson Correlation").
  FILTER (STR(?model) = "MedSTS").
}
```
    Note that this is just an example output and the actual output may vary based on the provided input and context. 

    You can assume that the entities and properties in the ORKG are correctly linked and there are no typos in the input question. 

    You can also assume that the SPARQL query is executed on the ORKG, and the query will return the correct answer. 

    The query is designed to find the model that performed best in terms of Pearson Correlation metric on the MedSTS benchmark dataset. 

    The query first identifies the model that has a Pearson Correlation metric, then filters the results to only include models that are the MedSTS benchmark dataset. 

    The query uses the following predicates:
    - orkgp:has_model
    - orkgp:has_metric
    - ork:relatedTo
    - orkgc:Resource
    - orkgc:Dataset
    - rdfs:label
    - rdf:type
    - FILTER (STR(?metric) = "Pearson Correlation")
    - FILTER (STR(?model) = "MedSTS")

    The query returns the model and metric that satisfy the conditions. 

    Note that the query may return multiple models, but we assume that there is only one model that performed best in terms of Pearson Correlation metric on the MedSTS benchmark dataset. 

    Also note that the query does not return any additional information about the model, such as its performance metrics or its features. 

    The query is designed to provide a simple answer to the input question, and it does not provide any additional context or explanations. 

    Finally, note that the query uses a simple filtering approach to find the model that performed best in terms of Pearson Correlation metric on the MedSTS benchmark dataset. 

    The query does not use any advanced techniques, such as ranking or aggregation, to find the model. 

    Instead, the query simply returns the first model that satisfies the conditions. 

    This approach may not be suitable for all
