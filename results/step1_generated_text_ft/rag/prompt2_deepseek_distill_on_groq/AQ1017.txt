Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Can you list the metrics used to evaluate models on the BUCC Russian-to-English dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "metrics" and "BUCC Russian-to-English dataset." The property implied is "evaluate models on," which relates models to the dataset using specific metrics.

Looking at the context data, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there's information about steps in a method, like using CRF algorithms and filtering entity candidates. There are also publications with details like authors and venues. However, I don't see any direct mention of evaluation metrics or the BUCC dataset.

Since the context doesn't provide specific metrics or the dataset, I can't retrieve any relevant candidates. Therefore, the candidates for both "metrics" and "BUCC Russian-to-English dataset" will be empty in the JSON output.

```json
{
  "question": "Can you list the metrics used to evaluate models on the BUCC Russian-to-English dataset?",
  "extracted_terms": [
    {
      "rdfs:label": "metrics",
      "type": "Class",
      "rdf:type": "rdfs:Class"
    },
    {
      "rdfs:label": "BUCC Russian-to-English dataset",
      "type": "Dataset",
      "rdf:type": "orkgc:Resource"
    },
    {
      "rdfs:label": "evaluate models on",
      "type": "Property",
      "rdf:type": "orkgp:Predicate"
    }
  ],
  "candidates": {
    "metrics": [],
    "BUCC Russian-to-English dataset": [],
    "evaluate models on": []
  }
}
