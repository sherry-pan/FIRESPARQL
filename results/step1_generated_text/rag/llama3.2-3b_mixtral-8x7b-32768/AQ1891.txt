     PREFIX orkgr: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/orkgr/>
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/orkgp/>

     SELECT?dataset?benchmark 
     WHERE {
    ?benchmark orkgr:hasBenchmark?dataset.
     FILTER (REGEX(STR(?dataset), "MPQA") || REGEX(STR(?dataset), "Benchmark MPQA"))
     }
     ```
