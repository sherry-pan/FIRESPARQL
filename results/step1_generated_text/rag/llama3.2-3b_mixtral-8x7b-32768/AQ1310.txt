Question:
What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the Atari 2600 Boxing dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://orkp.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkg.org/predicate/>

SELECT?metric?value
WHERE {
 ?dataset orkg:hasDataset?dataset1.
 ?dataset1 orkp:hasBenchmarkResult?result.
 ?result orkgp:hasMetric?metric.
 ?result orkgp:hasValue?value.
  FILTER (str(?dataset1) = "Atari 2600 Boxing")
}
``` 
    Note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be modified based on the actual structure of the ORKG. The above query is based on the provided context. 

    If there are multiple possible answers, you should provide all of them separated by a comma. 

    If the question does not have a clear answer (e.g., the question is too vague), indicate "No Answer" in the answer box. 

    Do not forget to add the boxed notation to your final answer.
