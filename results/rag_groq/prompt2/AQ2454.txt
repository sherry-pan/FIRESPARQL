Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the code links in papers that use the GPT-2 (small) model in any benchmark?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "GPT-2 (small) model" and "code links." The property involved is "use" since the question is about papers that use the model. So, I have two main terms: "GPT-2 (small)" and "code links."

Next, I need to compute the similarity between these terms and the entities in the RDF data. Looking at the context, I see mentions of models like SVM and datasets like MNIST, but nothing directly about GPT-2. However, there are papers with URLs and DOIs, which might be the code links.

I'll start by searching for entities related to GPT-2. Since it's not explicitly mentioned, I'll look for similar models or related terms. The context includes resources like R284317, which has a URL, but it's about a different model. I'll note that as a possible candidate.

For "code links," I'm looking for properties that link to URLs or DOIs. In the context, I see predicates like "url" and "P26" which seem to hold these links. I'll extract these as they are relevant.

Now, I'll compute the cosine similarity. Since GPT-2 isn't present, I'll look for similar models. R284317 mentions "Rajesh Bhatia" and "Amit Gupta," which might be related to GPT-2, but it's a stretch. The URL "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075" is a good candidate for a code link.

I'll select the top candidates. For "GPT-2 (small)," the closest is R284317, even though it's not a direct match. For "code links," the URL from R284317 is the top candidate.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON output, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including their URIs, labels, scores, and types. I'll make sure to use the correct RDF prefixes and include the necessary types like "orkgc:Resource" and "orkgp:Predicate."

I think that's all. The answer should list the relevant papers and their code links based on the extracted terms and their similarity scores.
