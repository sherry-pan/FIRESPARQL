Question:
List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the ART/CoreSC benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?metric?metricLabel
WHERE {
 ?metric rdfs:label?metricLabel.
  BIND(orkgr:AIDA AS?metric).
  BIND(orkgr:MEANTIME AS?metric).
  BIND(orkgr:TAC-KBP AS?metric).
  BIND(orkgr:MNIST AS?metric).
}
``` 
    Note: The SPARQL query is based on the provided JSON output and assumes the existence of the specified resources and predicates in the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    The query is designed to retrieve the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the ART/CoreSC benchmark dataset. It uses the `rdfs:label` property to get the labels of the metrics, and binds the specified URIs to the `?metric` variable. 

    The query can be executed against the ORKG RDF data dump to retrieve the desired metrics. 

    Please note that this is a simplified example and may need to be adapted to the actual structure and content of the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Also, the `?metric` variable is bound to the specified URIs, which may not be the actual metrics themselves but rather the resources that represent them. 

    To get the actual metrics, additional filtering or processing may be necessary. 

    The query assumes that the `orkgr:AIDA`, `orkgr:MEANTIME`, `orkgr:TAC-KBP`, and `orkgr:MNIST` URIs are valid and exist in the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    If these URIs do not exist or are not valid, the query will return an error. 

    To handle this scenario, additional error handling or validation may be necessary. 

    The query can be modified or extended to accommodate additional metrics or resources. 

    Please consult the ORKG documentation and RDF data dump for more information on the available resources and predicates. 

    The query can be executed using a SPARQL query engine or client, such as SPARQL query language or a graph database. 

    The output of the query will be a set of tuples containing the metric URIs and their corresponding labels. 

    The actual output may vary depending on the structure and content of the ORKG RDF data dump.
