Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question: "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Concept Mention Extraction model for benchmarking purposes?"

First, I'll break down the question. The user is looking for code references in papers, specifically where the Concept Mention Extraction model was used for benchmarking. So, I need properties related to code, benchmarking, and possibly papers or implementations.

Looking at the JSON properties, I see several that might be relevant. 

1. "HAS_BENCHMARK" seems directly related because benchmarking is part of the question. This property likely points to where benchmarks are mentioned.

2. "HAS_IMPLEMENTATION" is about how something is implemented, which could include code references in papers.

3. "HAS_DATASET" might be useful if the benchmarking involved specific datasets, but it's a bit less direct.

4. "IMPLEMENTATION" is another possible fit since it's about how the model is realized, which could include code.

5. "EVALUATION" is relevant because benchmarking is a form of evaluation, so this property might link to where the model was evaluated, possibly including code references.

I should list these properties with explanations of why each is relevant. I'll make sure each entry includes the IRI, label, and a brief reason.
