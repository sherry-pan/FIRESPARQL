Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PNDec model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
        ?paper a orkgc:Paper;
                 rdfs:label?title.
         FILTER(REGEX(?title, "PNDec"))
        ?paper orkgp:P31?contrib.
        ?contrib?paper orkgp:P32?code.
        ?code rdfs:label?code
     }<|eot_id|>
