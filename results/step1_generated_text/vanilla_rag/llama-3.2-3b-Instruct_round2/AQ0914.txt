Question:
Can you list the metrics used to evaluate models on the Barabasi-Albert dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/>
     SELECT?metric (COUNT(*) AS count) 
     WHERE {
     {
    ?metric orkg:hasBenchmark orkg:hasEvaluation.
     }
     GROUP BY?metric
     HAVING (COUNT(*) >= 1)
     ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
     }<|eot_id|>
