Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PEGASUS model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?paper?paperCode
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:HAS_METHOD "PEGASUS".
    ?benchmark orkg:HAS_EVALUATION?evaluation.
    ?evaluation orkg:HAS_IMPLEMENTATION?paperCode.
     }<|eot_id|>
