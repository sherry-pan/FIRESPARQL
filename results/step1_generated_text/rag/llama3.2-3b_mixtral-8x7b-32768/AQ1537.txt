Question:
What is the name of the top performing model in terms of Number of params score when benchmarked on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orgr: <http://example.org/orgr/>

    SELECT?model?score?dataset
    WHERE {
     ?model orkgc:HAS_MODEL?modelName.
     ?model orkgc:HAS_SCORE?score.
     ?model orkgc:HAS_EVALUATION?evaluation.
     ?evaluation orkgp:HAS_dataset?dataset.
     ?dataset orgr:R122689.
      FILTER (str(?model) = "Top Performing Model"^^xsd:string).
      FILTER (str(?score) = "Number of params"^^xsd:string).
      FILTER (str(?dataset) = "Penn Treebank (Character Level) Dataset"^^xsd:string).
    }
    ``` Sparql Query
    The final answer is: 
```
    ```sparql

      FILTER (str(?dataset) = "Penn Treebank (Character Level) Dataset"^^xsd:string).
    }
    ``` Sparql Query
    Note: The provided SPARQL query is just a template and may not work as is, as it relies on the specific structure of the ORKG and the values of the entities and properties mentioned in the question. It may need to be modified to match the actual structure of the ORKG and the values of the entities and properties. 

    The query is trying to find a model with the label "Top Performing Model" that has a score with the label "Number of params" and was evaluated on the dataset with the label "Penn Treebank (Character Level) Dataset". However, without knowing the actual structure of the ORKG and the values of the entities and properties, it's impossible to say for sure whether this query will work or not
