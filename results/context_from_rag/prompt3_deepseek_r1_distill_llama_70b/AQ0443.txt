Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the query: "Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the UCF101 (finetuned) dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "research paper titles", "IDs", "benchmarked models", and "UCF101 (finetuned) dataset". The properties involved are "benchmarked models on" and "UCF101 dataset".

Looking through the context, I see that there are resources related to papers, such as R147246 and R283710, which have properties like P27 (authors), P28 (issue), P29 (year), and P31 (type). These might help identify the papers.

For the dataset, I'm looking for mentions of UCF101. In the context, I don't see any direct references to UCF101, but there are mentions of other datasets like MNIST. However, since the context doesn't have UCF101, I might have to infer or see if there's a related resource.

The properties like P39020 describe steps, which might not be directly relevant. I need to find predicates that link papers to datasets and models. P31 is used for types, so maybe that can help identify papers as resources.

I'll list the papers from the context. R147246 has authors like Ligia Sierra and others, published in 2015. R283710 has authors Yuanyuan Wu and others, published in 2021. These could be the candidates.

Since there's no direct mention of UCF101, I'll have to assume that these papers might have benchmarked models on various datasets, possibly including UCF101. Alternatively, I might need to look for papers that discuss model benchmarking, even if the specific dataset isn't mentioned.

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and the candidates. Each paper will be listed with its URI, title, and type. Since the exact dataset isn't in the context, I'll include the papers that are related to models and benchmarking.

I need to ensure that the URIs use the correct prefixes: "orkgr:" for resources, "orkgp:" for predicates, etc. Each candidate should have a URI, label, and type.

Finally, I'll compile the JSON, grouping the results under each extracted term and listing the top candidates.
