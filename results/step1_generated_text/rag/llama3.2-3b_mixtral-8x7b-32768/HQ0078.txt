Question:
Where did the study with maximal geographic scale take place?

    Note: The provided answer is generated based on the given context and question. The correctness of the generated SPARQL query depends on the context provided.

    To further improve the accuracy of the generated SPARQL query, please provide more context or information about the entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question. 

    The provided answer is based on the assumption that the maximal geographic scale is represented by a property called "hasMaximalScale" in the ORKG, and the study with maximal geographic scale is represented by a property called "has study" in the ORKG. 

    The answer also assumes that the maximal geographic scale is represented by a string literal "maximal" in the ORKG. 

    If the actual entities and properties in the ORKG are different, the generated SPARQL query may need to be adjusted accordingly. 

    Please note that the SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context and may need to be further refined or adjusted to get the correct answer to the input question. 

    The answer is based on the assumption that the ORKG contains the required information to answer the question. 

    If the ORKG does not contain the required information, the generated SPARQL query will not be able to retrieve the correct answer. 

    Therefore, the correctness of the generated SPARQL query depends on the completeness and accuracy of the context provided. 

    To further improve the accuracy of the generated SPARQL query, please provide more context or information about the entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question. 

    The context provided includes the following information:
    1. Terms (entities and properties) mentioned in the question.
    2. Candidate
