Question:
List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the CoQA benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?metric,?metric_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?benchmark       a            orkgc:Benchmark;
                       rdfs:label      ?benchmark_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?benchmark_lbl) = "coQA")
      ?dataset         orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?benchmark;
                        orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION     ?eval.
      ?eval             rdfs:label              ?metric_lbl.
      ?eval             orkgp:P31               ?metric;
                        orkgp:P32               ?eval_metric.
      ?eval_metric      orkgp:P31               ?metric;
                        rdfs:label              ?metric_lbl.
     } 
     ORDER BY DESC(?metric_lbl)
     LIMIT 5

    Note that the original response contains a JSON-formatted answer, which is not included in this output. The provided SPARQL query is designed to extract the relevant metrics from the ORKG RDF data and return them in the specified format. The query first filters the data to include only benchmarks labeled "coQA", then extracts the evaluation metrics and their corresponding labels. Finally, it sorts the results in descending order by label and limits the output to the top 5 metrics. 

    The provided context information is not included in the output as it is not part of the SPARQL query. However, it provides a clear understanding of the approach used to answer the question and the relevant metrics extracted from the data. 

    The SPARQL query can be executed on the ORKG RDF data dump to retrieve the metrics used to evaluate models on the coQA benchmark dataset. 

    The query assumes that the relevant evaluation metrics are of type Evaluation and have a corresponding label. The metrics are then sorted in descending order by their labels and limited to the top 5. 

    The use of the `rdfs:label` and `orkgp:P31`/`orkgp:P32` properties in the query allows for the extraction of the metric labels and the corresponding evaluation metrics. 

    The `FILTER (str(?benchmark_lbl) = "coQA")` clause is used to filter the data to include only benchmarks labeled "coQA". 

    The `ORDER BY DESC(?metric_lbl)` and `LIMIT 5` clauses are used to sort the results in descending order by label and limit the output to the top 5 metrics, respectively. 

    The query is designed to be executed on the ORKG RDF data dump to retrieve the relevant metrics. 

    The query can be modified to retrieve additional metrics or to modify the sorting and limiting of the results. 

    The query can also be used as a starting point for further analysis or comparison of evaluation metrics across different benchmarks.
