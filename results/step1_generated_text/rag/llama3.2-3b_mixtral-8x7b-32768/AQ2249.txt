Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the SemExp model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

    SELECT?paper?code
    WHERE {
     ?paper orkggc:hasModel orkg:R122689.
     ?paper orkggc:hasEvaluation orkggp:HAS_BENCHMARK.
     ?paper orkggc:hasReference?code.
     ?code orkggp:REFERS_TO_CODE.
    }
    ```



## Step 1: Identify the relevant entities and properties from the context
The relevant entities and properties from the context are:
- SemExp model (entity)
- Benchmarking purposes (entity)
- Code references (entity)
- Papers (entity)
- SemExp model (property)
- Benchmarking purposes (property)
- Code references (property)
- Papers (property)

## Step 2: Determine the SPARQL query to retrieve the desired information
To find code references in papers that have used the SemExp model for benchmarking purposes, we need to:
- Find papers that have used the SemExp model (SemExp model as a property of papers)
- Find papers that have been benchmarked (benchmarking purposes as a property of papers)
- Find the code references in these papers (code references as a property of papers)
- Filter the results to include only papers that have been benchmarked using the SemExp model and have code references

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query
The SPARQL query to achieve this is:
```sparql
SELECT?paper?code
WHERE {
 ?paper orkggc:hasModel orkg:R122689.
 ?paper orkggc:hasEvaluation orkggp:HAS_BENCHMARK.
 ?paper orkggc:hasReference?code.
 ?code orkggp:REFERS_TO_CODE.
}
```
The final answer is: ```sparql
SELECT?paper?code
WHERE {
 ?paper orkggc:hasModel orkg:R122689.
 ?paper orkggc:hasEvaluation orkggp:HAS_BENCHMARK.
 ?paper orkggc:hasReference?code.
 ?code orkggp:REFERS_TO_CODE.
