       ];
        orkgp:P31 [
         rdfs:label?model
       ].
       FILTER(REGEX(STR(?model), "AlexNet, MultiGrasp"))
      ?paper orkgp:P31 [
         rdfs:label?model
       ];
        orkgp:P32 [
         orkgp:HAS_IMPLEMENTATION {
           orkgp:HAS_CODE?code
         }
       ]
     }<|eot_id|>
