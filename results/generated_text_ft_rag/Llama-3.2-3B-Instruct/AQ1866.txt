Question:
What are the most commonly used benchmark datasets for the Natural Language Inference research field?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?label
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgp:P32?cont.
 ?cont orkgp:P33?dataset.
  FILTER(REGEX(STR(?dataset), "NLI"))
}
``` 
    Note: The query is based on the assumption that the dataset is linked to a contribution via the `orkgp:P33` property and the contribution is linked to a paper via the `orkgp:P32` property. The `FILTER(REGEX(STR(?dataset), "NLI"))` clause filters the results to only include datasets with "NLI" in their labels. 

    The query is not optimized for performance and is intended for illustrative purposes only. For production use, consider optimizing the query for the specific use case and dataset. 

    The query assumes that the dataset label is the same as the dataset URI. If this is not the case, the `?label` variable in the `SELECT` clause should be modified to reference the correct label property. 

    The query does not take into account the context provided in the question, but rather relies on the `FILTER(REGEX(STR(?dataset), "NLI"))` clause to filter the results. 

    The query does not consider the cosine similarity between the query terms and the entities/properties in the data. 

    The query does not return the top 10 similar entities, but rather a list of distinct dataset labels.
