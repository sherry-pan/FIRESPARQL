Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The query is asking to list the code links in papers that use the DocRED-BiLSTM model in any benchmark. 

First, I'll break down the query to extract the relevant terms. The main entities here are "DocRED-BiLSTM model" and "code links in papers." The action is "use" in the context of benchmarks.

Looking at the context data, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there are resources like R147246 and R283710, which are papers with authors and publication details. The predicates include P27 for authors, P28 for issue numbers, P29 for years, and P31 for types. 

I need to find entities related to the DocRED-BiLSTM model. However, scanning through the context, I don't see any direct mentions of this model. The models mentioned are SVM and MNIST in the steps, but those are different. 

Next, I look for code links. The context doesn't provide explicit links or URIs for code. It mainly describes the process of entity extraction and the structure of the data. 

Since the context doesn't have information about the DocRED-BiLSTM model or code links, I can't extract any specific candidates. The steps provided in the context are about a method involving seed terms, expansion, and NER approaches, but they don't relate directly to the query.

Therefore, based on the given context, there are no relevant entities or properties that match the query. The JSON output should reflect that no candidates were found for the extracted terms.
