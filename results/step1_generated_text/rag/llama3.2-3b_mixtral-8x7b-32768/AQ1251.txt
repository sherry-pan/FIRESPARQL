Question:
What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset MLDoc Zero-Shot English-to-Spanish?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.io/ontology/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://orkg.io/ontology#>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkg.io/ontology#>

SELECT?metric?value
WHERE {
 ?resource orkgc:hasDataset orkgr:R122689.
 ?resource orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK_RESULT?benchmarkResult.
 ?benchmarkResult orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
 ?benchmarkResult orkgp:HAS_VALUE?value.
  FILTER (STR(?metric) = "Top").
  FILTER (STR(?value) = "Best").
}
``` 
    Note that the SPARQL query is constructed based on the provided context. The query is designed to find the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset MLDoc Zero-Shot English-to-Spanish. The query uses the provided predicates (HAS_BENCHMARK_RESULT, HAS_METRIC, HAS_VALUE) to link to the entities and properties in the ORKG. The filters (STR(?metric) = "Top" and STR(?value) = "Best") are used to narrow down the results to the desired metric and value. 

    Please note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual data in the ORKG. 

    Also, the ORKG is a complex knowledge graph, and the query may need to be optimized for performance. 

    The provided context and the SPARQL query are designed to work together to provide the correct answer to the input question. 

    The context provides the necessary information to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG, and the SPARQL query uses this information to retrieve the correct answer.
