Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Rotowire (Content Selection) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?paperTitle?paperURI 
WHERE {
 ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkg:hasURI "http://example.org/Rotowire_Content_Selection_Dataset".
 ?paper orkg:hasURI?paperURI.
 ?paper orkg:hasTitle?paperTitle.
  BIND(URI(?paperURI) AS?paperURI).
  BIND(CONCAT(?paperTitle, " ") AS?paperTitle).
}
```    Note: The actual SPARQL query might need adjustments based on the actual RDF data available in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). This is just an example query based on the provided context and question.<|eot_id|>
