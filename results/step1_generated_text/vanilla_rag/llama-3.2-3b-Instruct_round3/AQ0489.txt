Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the SNLI dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:hasDataset <http://example.org/SNLI>.
    ?paper orkg:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Titles?title.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Number?id.
     FILTER (REGEX(?title, "SNLI") || REGEX(?id, "SNLI"))
     }<|eot_id|>
