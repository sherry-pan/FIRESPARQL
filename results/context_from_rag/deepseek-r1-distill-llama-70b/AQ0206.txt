Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question about models tested on the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std benchmark dataset. Let me break this down.

First, the question is asking for a list of models that have been tested on a specific dataset. So, I'm looking for properties related to models, testing, datasets, and benchmarks.

Looking at the JSON properties, I see several that might be relevant. 

1. "has benchmark" (property: HAS_BENCHMARK) seems directly related because it likely refers to benchmark datasets used in evaluations.
2. "evaluation" (HAS_EVALUATION) is also relevant because it would involve testing models on datasets.
3. "has dataset" (HAS_DATASET) is important since the question is about a specific dataset.
4. "method" (HAS_METHOD) could refer to the models or approaches used, which are tested on the dataset.
5. "implementation" (HAS_IMPLEMENTATION) might relate to how models are set up for testing.

I don't see any properties that directly mention models, but these seem like the closest matches. They all relate to testing, datasets, and methods, which are key parts of the question.

The most relevant properties from the JSON file that could help answer the question about models tested on the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std benchmark dataset are:

[
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_BENCHMARK",
    "label": "has benchmark",
    "reason": "This property is relevant because it relates to benchmark datasets used for testing models."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_EVALUATION",
    "label": "evaluation",
    "reason": "This property is relevant as it pertains to the evaluation of models, which includes testing on datasets."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_DATASET",
    "label": "has dataset",
    "reason": "This property is directly related to datasets used in testing and benchmarking."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_METHOD",
    "label": "method",
    "reason": "This property could refer to the methods or models applied to the dataset for testing."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_IMPLEMENTATION",
    "label": "implementation",
    "reason": "This property relates to how models are implemented and tested on datasets."
  }
