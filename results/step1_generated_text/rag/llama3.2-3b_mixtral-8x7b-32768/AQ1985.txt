Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the BART model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
    PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
    PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
    
    SELECT?paper?code 
    WHERE {
       ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?p1.
       ?p1 orkgp:UTILIZES?b.
       ?b orkgr:R44243.
       ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
        SERVICE wikibase:label { bind(wikibase:label(?paper), :lang("en") as?paperLabel) }
    }
    ```


## Step 1: Understand the context and the question
The context provides information about the terms mentioned in the question, including the BART model, papers, utilized, and links to their code. It also lists candidate entities and properties in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) that can be linked to these terms.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant entities and properties
From the context, we can identify the following entities and properties:
- Entity: BART model
- Property: utilized
- Entity: papers
- Property: HAS_PAPER
- Entity: links to their code
- Property: HAS_CODE

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query
To construct the SPARQL query, we need to follow these steps:
- Select the relevant entities: paper and code
- Filter papers that have utilized the BART model
- Filter papers that have links to their code

## Step 4: Write the SPARQL query
The SPARQL query should look like this:
```sparql
SELECT?paper?code 
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?p1.
 ?p1 orkgp:UTILIZES?b.
 ?b orkgr:R44243.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bind(wikibase:label(?paper), :lang("en") as?paperLabel) }
}
```

The final answer is: ```sparql
SELECT?paper?code 
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?p1.
