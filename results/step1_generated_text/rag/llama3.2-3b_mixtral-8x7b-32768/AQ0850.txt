Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the TempEval-3 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>

SELECT?evaluationMetric?benchmarkingModel?dataset 
WHERE {
 ?evaluationMetric orkgr:R122690 orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION_METRIC.
 ?benchmarkingModel orkgr:R122690 orkgp:HAS_MODEL.
 ?dataset orkgr:R122690 orkgp:HAS_DATASET.
}
```

    Note: The provided SPARQL query is just one possible query that could be generated based on the input question and context. There may be other valid SPARQL queries that could also be generated based on the input question and context. The provided SPARQL query is for demonstration purposes only.
    If you want to generate a new SPARQL query, you can simply modify the provided SPARQL query or generate a new one based on the input question and context. 

    If you want to use a different approach, you can use the following template and fill in the blanks with the relevant information:
    ```
SELECT?evaluationMetric?benchmarkingModel?dataset 
WHERE {
