Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the WSC dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "research papers," "benchmark," and "WSC dataset." "Research papers" are likely instances of a class, "benchmark" is a property, and "WSC dataset" is a specific resource.

Next, I'll look through the context information to find related entities and properties. From the given data, I see mentions of papers like R147246 and R284317, which have properties like P27 (authors), P29 (year), and P28 (volume). There's also a mention of "validation research" and "technique" in R284316, which might relate to benchmarks.

I'll compute the similarity scores based on how closely these entities match the extracted terms. For example, R284317 is a journal article about validation research, which might involve benchmarks, so it scores high. R147246 is another paper that could be relevant.

Finally, I'll select the top candidates. R284317 and R147246 seem the most relevant, so they'll be included in the results with their titles, IDs, and scores.
