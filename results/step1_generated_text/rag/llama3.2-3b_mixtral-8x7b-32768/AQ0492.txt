Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the enwik8 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT?title?id WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:hasTitle?title.
 ?paper ora:hasID?id.
 ?paper ora:hasBenchmarkedModel?model.
 ?model ora:hasBenchmarkedOn?dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasDataset?datasetLabel.
 ?dataset ora:hasName?datasetName.
 ?paper ora:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasName?datasetName.
 ?paper ora:hasBenchmarkedModel?model.
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasName?datasetName.
  FILTER (STR(?datasetName) = "enwik8").
  FILTER (STR(?title)!= "").
}
```
    Note that the actual SPARQL query will be executed on the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), which may have different query results depending on the actual data in the ORKG. The actual results may contain additional information or errors not present in this example. 

    The provided SPARQL query retrieves a list of research papers that have benchmarked models on the enwik8 dataset. The query first filters the papers that have benchmarked models on the enwik8 dataset, then filters the papers that have non-empty titles. The results are the titles and IDs of the papers that meet these conditions. 

    The query uses the following properties and entities from the ORKG:
    - Research paper: ora:ResearchPaper
    - Title: ora:hasTitle
    - ID: ora:hasID
    - Benchmarking model: ora:hasBenchmarkedModel
    - Dataset: ora:hasDataset
    - Dataset name: ora:hasName
    - Filter for enwik8 dataset: Filter (STR(?datasetName) = "enwik8")
    - Filter for non-empty title: Filter (STR(?title)!= "")
    Note that the actual query results may vary depending on the data in the ORKG. 

    The query is designed to retrieve the correct answer to the input question, "Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the enwik8 dataset?" The query uses the provided context to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG. 

    The query is written in SPARQL query language and can be executed on the ORKG to retrieve the results. 

    The actual results may contain additional information or errors not present in this example.
