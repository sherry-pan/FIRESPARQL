Okay, so I need to figure out the evaluation metrics used over the PWC Leaderboards dataset. Let me start by breaking down the question. The user is asking about evaluation metrics, specifically over the PWC Leaderboards dataset. 

First, I should identify the key terms here. The main entities are "evaluation metrics" and "PWC Leaderboards dataset." The properties involved would likely relate to how these metrics are measured or applied.

Looking at the context data, I see that there are several resources related to evaluation. For example, there's a resource about "Graph analytics" and another about "Named entity recognition." There's also mention of specific metrics like F1-score and accuracy.

I remember that in the example provided, the user was looking for models tested on the MPQA dataset. The response included specific URIs like "orkgr:R131168" and "orkgr:R122689." So, I should look for similar patterns here.

I need to extract terms from the question. The question is about evaluation metrics, so the extracted terms would be "evaluation metrics" and "PWC Leaderboards dataset." The properties might include things like "hasMetric," "metricType," or "evaluatedOn."

Now, I should find the top similar entities or properties related to these terms. Looking through the context data, I can see entries like "Graph analytics," "Named entity recognition," and "F1-score." These seem relevant because they are related to evaluation methods.

I should list the top candidates. From the data, I see URIs like "orkgr:R283709," "orkgr:R283710," and others related to F1-score and accuracy. These are likely the specific metrics used for evaluation.

I need to structure the JSON output correctly. The question is about metrics, so the candidates should include each metric with its URI and type. For example, "F1-score" would have a URI like "orkgr:R123456" and be of type "orkgc:Metric."

I also need to ensure that I'm using the correct RDF prefixes. For properties, it's "orkgp:" and for classes, "orkgc:." So, each metric should be properly categorized with the right type.

Putting it all together, the JSON should have the question, extracted terms, and candidates with their URIs and types. I should make sure each entry is correctly formatted and that the URIs match the context data provided.
