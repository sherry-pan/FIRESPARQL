Question:
List the code links in papers that use the Dynamic Coattention Networks (single model) model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:

```    Note: The SPARQL query is written in the standard SPARQL query language. The `PREFIX` statements define the prefixes for the URIs used in the query. The `SELECT` statement specifies the variables to be returned. The `WHERE` clause defines the conditions under which the query will return results. The `FILTER` statement is used to filter the results based on the presence of certain strings. The `CONTAINS` function checks if a string is a substring of another string.<|eot_id|>
