Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the dqnmmcesr model for benchmarking purposes?" using the provided ORKG RDF data.

First, I'll break down the question. The key terms here are "code references," "papers," "dqnmmcesr model," and "benchmarking." So, I need to extract these terms from the question.

Looking at the context data, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there's R147656 which is about a method with a value of 93.9. Then there are resources like R147244, R147246, etc., with various properties. I also notice that some resources are connected via P27, which seems to denote authors, and P31 which links to other resources.

I need to find entities related to "code references." In the data, I see mentions of "method," "solution proposal," and "entity extraction." Maybe "method" is related to code. Then, "papers" would be resources of type "Journal Article" or similar. The "dqnmmcesr model" isn't directly mentioned, but perhaps it's related to "models" in general, which are discussed in the context. Benchmarking is mentioned in the context as well, with terms like "benchmark" and "evaluation."

Next, I'll look for properties that connect these entities. For example, P39020 describes steps, which might include how models are benchmarked. P27 and p27 are about authors and contributors, which might not be directly relevant. P31 links resources, which could be useful for finding related papers.

I'll need to retrieve the top 10 most similar entities or properties. Since "dqnmmcesr" isn't present, I'll look for similar models or methods. Resources like R147656 and R283709 seem relevant as they discuss methods and models. For papers, R147246 and R283710 are journal articles, so they might have code references.

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their candidates. Each term will have a list of URIs with their labels and types. I'll make sure to use the correct prefixes like orkgr, orkgs, etc.

Finally, I'll ensure the JSON is properly formatted, grouping the results by each extracted term and including the necessary details for each candidate.
