Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Large mLSTM model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?code
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:HAS_PAPER?p1.
    ?paper orkg:HAS_MODEL?m1.
    ?paper orkg:UTILIZES?u1.
    ?m1 orkg:HAS_MODEL?m2.
    ?m2 orkg:HAS_CODE?code.
    ?p1 a orkg:Paper.
    ?m2 rdfs:label?m2Label.
    ?code orkg:uri?codeURI.
     FILTER (STR(?m2Label) = "Large mLSTM model" && STR(?codeURI) = "https://github.com/..." )
     }
     Filtered results:
    ?paper?code
    ?paper orkg:uri "https://github.com/..."
    ?paper orkg:uri "https://github.com/..."

    Note: The provided answer is not the solution to the problem but rather the correct SPARQL query based on the given input question and context. 

    The problem that this query is solving is to find papers that have utilized the Large mLSTM model and return the links to their code. The query uses the predicates provided in the context to link the correct entities in the ORKG to the entities and properties mentioned in the input question. 

    The query works as follows:
    1. It first selects all papers that have used the Large mLSTM model and have included links to their code. 
    2. It then filters the results to only include papers that have utilized the Large mLSTM model.
    3. The final results include the paper's URI and the link to its code. 

    Note: The actual code for the ORKG might vary and the provided query might not work as-is. The query is based on the provided context and might need adjustments to fit the actual structure of the ORKG. 

    The correct answer is the SPARQL query itself, not the results or any other output. 

    ```python
    SELECT?paper?code
    WHERE {
       ?paper orkg:HAS_PAPER?p1.
       ?paper orkg:HAS_MODEL?m1.
       ?paper orkg:UTILIZES?u1.
       ?m1 orkg:HAS_MODEL?m2.
       ?m2 orkg:HAS_CODE?code.
       ?p1 a orkg:Paper.
       ?m2 rdfs:label?m2
