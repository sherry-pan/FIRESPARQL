Question:
What types of nanocarriers do have therapeutic effect?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
SELECT?nanocarrier?therapeuticEffect 
WHERE {
 ?nanocarrier orkg:hasTherapeuticEffect?therapeuticEffect.
}
``` 
    Note: The `http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R44242` is linked to the term "nanocarriers" and the `http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36045` is linked to the term "therapeutic effect". However, the term "therapeutic effect" is currently marked as "deleted" in the context. Therefore, we assume that the correct term is "therapeutic effect" itself, not the "deleted" version. Similarly, the term "nanocarriers" is linked to the term "Name Entity", but we assume that the correct term is "nanocarriers" itself, not "Name Entity". The SPARQL query above assumes that the correct term is "nanocarriers" itself, not "Name Entity". However, in the context, it is not clear if the term "nanocarriers" is the correct entity or the "Name Entity". Therefore, we do not assume any information about the entity "nanocarriers" and use the SPARQL query above to get the correct entities and properties. 

    The above SPARQL query can be further optimized to get the correct entities and properties. We assume that the correct entity is "nanocarriers" itself, not the "Name Entity". Therefore, we use the following SPARQL query to get the correct entities and properties:
     ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
SELECT?nanocarrier?therapeuticEffect 
WHERE {
 ?nanocarrier orkg:label?label.
  filter(strcontains(STR(?label), "nanocarriers")).
 ?nanocarrier orkg:hasTherapeuticEffect?therapeuticEffect.
}
``` 
    Note: The `http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R44243` is linked to the term "captures the meaning of the correlation between words based on multi-head attention", which is not relevant to the question. Therefore, we ignore this
