Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the SNLI dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology#>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearch.org/resource/>
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://www.openresearch.org/resource/>

    SELECT?paper?title?id
    WHERE {
     ?paper orkgp:has_benchmark orkgp:benchmarks?benchmark.
     ?benchmark orkgp:has_dataset orkgp:dataset?dataset.
     ?dataset orkgr:has_title?title.
     ?paper orkgc:has_id?id.
      FILTER (STR(?title) =~ "SNLI")
    }
    ```


Note: The SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context and the input question. The query is designed to query the ORKG and retrieve the required information. The query uses the provided predicates and resources from the context to filter the results. 

Please note that the actual query might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure and data in the ORKG. 

Also, note that the `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results based on the title of the paper containing the string "SNLI". This might not be the most efficient way to filter the results, and a more efficient approach might be to use a more specific predicate or resource to filter the results. 

The `?paper?title?id` part of the query selects the paper, title, and ID of each paper that has a benchmark on the SNLI dataset. 

The `?benchmark?dataset?title` part of the query selects the benchmark, dataset, and title of each benchmark that has a dataset with the title containing the string "SNLI". 

The `?paper?id` part of the query selects the paper and ID of each paper that has an ID. 

The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results based on the title of the paper containing the string "SNLI". 

Please note that the actual query might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure and data in the ORKG.

The `?benchmark?dataset?title` part of the query selects the benchmark, dataset, and title of each benchmark that has a dataset with the title containing the string "SNLI". 

The `?paper?id` part of the query selects the paper and ID of each paper that has an ID.
