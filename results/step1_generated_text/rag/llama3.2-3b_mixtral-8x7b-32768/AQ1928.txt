Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Tokenlearner model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?link
     WHERE {
       ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?paper1.
       ?paper1 orkgp:UTILIZES?utilized1.
       ?utilized1 orkgp:HAS_CODE?link.
       ?paper ork:en?paperLabel.
        FILTER(LONG(?paperLabel) > 0)
        UNION
       ?paper ork:en?paperLabel.
        FILTER(LONG(?paperLabel) > 0)
      } 
      GROUP BY?paper?link
      HAVING (COUNT(?paper) > 1)
      ORDER BY?paper
      LIMIT 10
    SPARQL Query:
    ```python
def get_sparql_query(question, context):
    #... (rest of the function remains the same)
    
    # Generate the SPARQL query based on the question and context
    sparql_query = """
    SELECT?paper?link
    WHERE {
       ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?paper1.
       ?paper1 orkgp:UTILIZES?utilized1.
       ?utilized1 orkgp:HAS_CODE?link.
       ?paper ork:en?paperLabel.
        FILTER(LONG(?paperLabel) > 0)
        UNION
       ?paper ork:en?paperLabel.
        FILTER(LONG(?paperLabel) > 0)
      } 
      GROUP BY?paper?link
      HAVING (COUNT(?paper) > 1)
      ORDER BY?paper
      LIMIT 10
    """
    
    return sparql_query
```

The function `get_sparql_query` takes in a natural language question and a context object as input, and returns a generated SPARQL query based on the question and context. The context object is expected to contain the extracted terms, candidates, and other relevant information.

Note that the function `get_sparql_query` is not fully implemented, and you will need to complete it to generate the correct SPARQL query.

Here is an example of how you might complete the function:

```python
def get_sparql_query(question, context):
    #... (rest of the function remains the same)
    
    # Extract the relevant terms and candidates from the context
    extracted_terms = context["extracted_terms"]
    candidates = context["candidates"]
    
    # Generate the SPARQL query based on the question and context
    sparql_query = """
    SELECT
