Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Shake-Shake (SAM) model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    
    SELECT?paper?code 
    WHERE {
   ?paper orkp:HAS_MODEL orkgr:R44243.
   ?paper orkp:UTILIZES orkp:UTILIZES.
   ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
    FILTER (REGEX(str(?paper), "Shake-Shake (SAM)") || REGEX(str(?paper), "model"))
    }
    ``` 

## Step 1: Identify the relevant terms and entities from the context
The relevant terms and entities from the context are:
- papers
- Shake-Shake (SAM) model
- utilized
- links to their code
- orkg:R147246
- orkp:UTILIZES
- orkp:HAS_CODE
- orkp:HAS_MODEL

## Step 2: Determine the entities and properties to be linked in the SPARQL query
The entities and properties to be linked in the SPARQL query are:
- papers (entity)
- Shake-Shake (SAM) model (entity)
- utilized (property)
- links to their code (property)

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query
The SPARQL query should filter the papers that have utilized the Shake-Shake (SAM) model and include the links to their code. The query should also check if the paper's label contains the words "Shake-Shake (SAM)" or "model".

```sparql
SELECT?paper?code 
WHERE {
   ?paper orkp:UTILIZES orkp:UTILIZES.
   ?paper orkp:HAS_MODEL orkgr:R44243.
   ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
    FILTER (REGEX(str(?paper), "Shake-Shake (SAM)") || REGEX(str(?paper), "model"))
}
```

The final answer is: ```sparql
SELECT?paper?code 
WHERE {
   ?paper orkp:UTILIZES orkp:UTILIZES.
   ?paper orkp:HAS_MODEL orkgr:R44243.
   ?paper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code
