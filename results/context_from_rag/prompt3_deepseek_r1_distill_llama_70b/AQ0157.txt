Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What models are being evaluated on the penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by understanding the structure of the data. The context information includes several RDF triples from an ORKG dump. Each triple has a subject, predicate, and object. The subjects are resources like R147244, R147246, etc., and the predicates are things like P39020, HAS_VALUE, P31, etc. The objects can be literals or other resources.

The question is asking about models evaluated on a specific dataset, specifically the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset. So, I need to identify which parts of the RDF data relate to models and datasets.

Looking at the context, I see that there are resources like R147244 which have a HAS_VALUE of "93.9". That might be a performance metric, but I'm not sure yet. Then there's R147246, which has multiple P27 predicates with values like "Ligia Sierra", "Betty L LÃ³pez", etc. These seem to be authors or contributors, so maybe R147246 is a paper or a publication.

Next, I see another resource R283709, which has predicates like P5044 with value "Journal Article", P41928 with "scholarly domain", and P3000 with a list of keywords like "Graph analytics", "Horizon 2020", "Keyphrase extraction", etc. This seems like a publication as well, possibly a paper about various methods and techniques.

The key here is to find models and the datasets they're evaluated on. So, I need to look for entities that represent models and see which datasets they are connected to.

In the context, I don't immediately see any resources that are explicitly labeled as models. However, there are resources like R147244 and R283709 which might be related to methods or approaches that could involve models. For example, R147244 has a HAS_VALUE of "93.9", which could be an accuracy score, which is often associated with model performance.

Now, looking for the dataset part: the question mentions the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset. I need to find if this dataset is mentioned in the context. Scanning through, I don't see "Penn Treebank" explicitly mentioned. The closest is R147244 with HAS_VALUE "93.9", but that's a number, not a dataset name.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The context includes a long string about an analysis performed on 32,090 funded projects, etc., but that's part of a larger description. It mentions keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition, which are NLP tasks, but not directly pointing to Penn Treebank.

So, perhaps the dataset in question isn't directly listed in the provided context. That complicates things because without the dataset being present, I can't find models evaluated on it.

Alternatively, maybe the models are mentioned in the context, and I can infer the dataset from their properties. For example, if a model is used for named entity recognition, it might be evaluated on a standard NLP dataset like Penn Treebank, even if it's not explicitly stated.

Looking again, R283709 has P3000 with "Named entity recognition" as one of the keywords. So, this resource is related to NER. If models are being evaluated on Penn Treebank, which is a common dataset for NLP tasks, perhaps R283709 is connected to such models.

But without the dataset being explicitly mentioned, I can't directly link the models to Penn Treebank. So, maybe the answer would involve models related to NER, assuming they might be evaluated on Penn Treebank, even if it's not stated.

Another angle: the context includes steps for a method involving SVM and MNIST as seed terms. SVM is a model, and MNIST is a dataset. So, perhaps the method described uses SVM on MNIST. But the question is about models on Penn Treebank, which isn't mentioned here.

So, perhaps the answer would involve models like SVM, but since the dataset isn't present, it's a bit of a stretch.

Alternatively, maybe the context includes other datasets. Looking again, I see mentions of "MPQA" in the example output, but that's not in the provided context. So, perhaps the context doesn't have the necessary data to answer the question accurately.

In that case, the top candidates might be models that are related to NER or other NLP tasks, even if the specific dataset isn't mentioned. So, models like those described in R283709, which is about NER, could be candidates.

But without explicit links to Penn Treebank, the answer would be speculative. Therefore, the best approach is to extract the models mentioned in the context and assume they might be evaluated on Penn Treebank, even if it's not directly stated.

So, the extracted terms would be "models" and "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset". Then, looking for models in the context, I find mentions of SVM and possibly others related to NER. However, the exact models aren't clearly listed, so the candidates might be inferred based on the context's discussion of methods and algorithms.

In conclusion, the answer would involve identifying models from the context that are likely to be evaluated on NLP datasets, even if Penn Treebank isn't explicitly mentioned. The top candidates would be models related to NER or other relevant tasks, possibly including SVM or other machine learning models discussed.
