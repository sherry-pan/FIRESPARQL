Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?metric?metric_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                  orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
  OPTIONAL {?eval           orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.
          ?metric          rdfs:label              ?metric_lbl.}
}
``` 
    Note: The SPARQL query is a solution to the problem, and it retrieves the desired information from the RDF data. The query is based on the context provided and the input question. The query uses the ORKG RDF data and the provided context to answer the question. 

    The query first filters the dataset to only include the "Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std" dataset. Then, it retrieves the benchmarking models associated with this dataset. For each benchmarking model, it checks if there is an evaluation and if there is a metric associated with this evaluation. If there is a metric, it retrieves the label of this metric. 

    The OPTIONAL clause is used to handle the case where there is no metric associated with the evaluation. In this case, the variable?metric and its label?metric_lbl are not bound, and the query continues to the next iteration. 

    The DISTINCT keyword is used to ensure that each metric and its label are only returned once.
