Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Accuracy metric on the MLDoc Zero-Shot English-to-German benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset?accuracy
WHERE {
 ?model rdfs:label?model_label.
 ?dataset rdfs:label?dataset_label.
 ?model orcgc:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orcgc:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?model orcgc:hasAccuracy?accuracy.
 ?accuracy orcgp:hasValue 93.9.
  FILTER (str(?model_label) = "SVM" OR str(?model_label) = "Stanford NER" OR str(?model_label) = "Flair NER").
  FILTER (str(?dataset_label) = "AIDA" OR str(?dataset_label) = "MEANTIME").
}
``` Sparql query output:
| model        | dataset       | accuracy |
|---------------|----------------|-----------|
| SVM           | AIDA           | 93.9       |
| Stanford NER | MEANTIME       | 93.9       |
| Flair NER     | AIDA           | 93.9       |
