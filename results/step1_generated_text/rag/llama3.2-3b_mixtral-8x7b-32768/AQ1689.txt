Question:
What is the best performing model benchmarking the Atari 2600 Seaquest dataset in terms of Score metric?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

    SELECT?m?d
    WHERE {
   ?m orkgp:HAS_MODEL orkg:R123456.
   ?m orkgp:BEST_PERFORMANCE?d.
   ?d orkgc:hasDataset orkgc:R122689.
   ?d orkgp:HAS_METRIC orkgp:SCORE_METRIC.
    FILTER(STR(?d) = "Seaquest").
    }
    ```


## Step 1: Analyze the input question and identify the key entities and properties mentioned.
The input question is "What is the best performing model benchmarking the Atari 2600 Seaquest dataset in terms of Score metric?" The key entities and properties mentioned are:
- Entity: "best performing model"
- Property: "benchmarking"
- Entity: "Atari 2600 Seaquest dataset"
- Property: "benchmarking"
- Entity: "Score metric"
- Property: "in terms of"

## Step 2: Match the extracted terms with the candidates provided in the context.
From the context, we have the following matches:
- "Atari 2600 Seaquest dataset" matches with the entity "Seaquest" and the dataset property "Has Dataset" (uri: orkg:R122689).
- "best performing model" matches with the property "Has Model" (uri: orkgp:HAS_MODEL) and the property "Best Performance" (uri: orkgp:BEST_PERFORMANCE).
- "Score metric" matches with the property "Has Metric" (uri: orkgp:HAS_METRIC) and the specific metric "Score Metric" (uri: orkgp:SCORE_METRIC).

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query based on the matched entities and properties.
To find the best performing model benchmarking the Atari 2600 Seaquest dataset in terms of Score metric, we need to:
- Find models that have been benchmarked (using "Has Model" and "Benchmarking").
- Filter to models that have been benchmarked the Seaquest dataset.
- Filter to models that use the Score metric.

The SPARQL query should
