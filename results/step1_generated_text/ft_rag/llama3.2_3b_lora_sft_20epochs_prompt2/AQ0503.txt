Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the BIOSSES dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_title
     WHERE {
       orkgr:R155230 orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
      ?dataset orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
      ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?eval.
       FILTER(REGEX(?eval, "BIOSSES"))
      ?benchmark orkgp:P31?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P7002?paper.
      ?paper orkgp:HAS_TITLE?title.
       BIND(xsd:string(?title) AS?paper_title)
     }<|eot_id|>
