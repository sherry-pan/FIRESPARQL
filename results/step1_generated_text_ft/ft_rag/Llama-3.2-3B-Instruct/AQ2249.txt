Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the SemExp model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
                 rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "SemExp")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
      ?cont           rdfs:label              ?cont_lbl.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_CODE_REFERENCE?code.
      ?code          orkgp:P31               ?cont.
     }

    Please note that the output is in the format of a SPARQL query, which is used to query a knowledge graph. The query is designed to retrieve code references in papers that have used the SemExp model for benchmarking purposes. The query works as follows:

1.  The query starts by selecting the `?code` variable.
2.  It then filters the models to only those labeled as "SemExp".
3.  Next, it retrieves the datasets associated with each benchmark, and then the contributions associated with each benchmark.
4.  For each contribution, it retrieves the model used and the code reference.
5.  Finally, it retrieves the label of the contribution and the code reference.

    You can run this query on the ORKG knowledge graph to retrieve the code references in papers that have used the SemExp model for benchmarking purposes. The query will return a list of code references, along with their corresponding contribution labels.<|eot_id|>
