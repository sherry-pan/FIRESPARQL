What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the BUCC German-to-English dataset?

    Note: This prompt is based on the data from the 2021 Data Science Bowl. 

    If you need any clarification, please ask.
    If you need any additional information, please ask.
    If you need any data, I will provide it. 

    Please proceed with the generating the SPARQL query. 

    Note: I will be judging the query based on its ability to answer the question, not its performance or efficiency. 

    You may use any of the vocabularies provided (orkgs, dbpedia, wikidata) to construct the query. 
    You may also use the SPARQL query syntax. 
    You may not use any external data sources. 

    The query should be able to handle the question and provide a meaningful answer. 
    Please proceed with generating the SPARQL query. 
    Please provide the query in the format specified above. 
    Please do not provide any additional text. 
    If you are unable to provide the query, please indicate so. 

    I will be providing the data for the dataset.

    I will be providing the data for the dataset. 

    Please proceed with generating the SPARQL query. 

    The query should be able
    ```python
    def generate_sparql_query(question):
        # Implement your logic to generate the SPARQL query
        # Here is an example of how you can implement it
        # For simplicity, let's assume the query is in the format:
        # SELECT?paper?id
        # WHERE {
        #  ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
        #  ?benchmark dbpedia:contains "BUCC German-to-English dataset".
        #  ?paper orkg:hasId?id.
        #  ?paper dbpedia:contains "English".
        #  ?paper wikidata:Q123456789.
        # }
        # LIMIT 10
        # 
        # So, we can generate the query by parsing the question and extracting the relevant information
        # For example:
        keywords = question.split()
        query = "SELECT?paper?id"
        where_clause = "WHERE {?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.?benchmark dbpedia:contains \"BUCC German-to-English dataset\".?paper orkg:hasId?id.?paper dbpedia:contains \"English\".?paper wikidata:Q123456789. }"
        query += " " + where_clause
        query += " LIMIT 10"
        return query

    question = "What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the BUCC German-to-English dataset?"
    query = generate_sparql_query(question)
    print(query)
```
