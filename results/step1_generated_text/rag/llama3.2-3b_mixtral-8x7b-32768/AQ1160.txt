Question:
What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset RotoWire (Relation Generation)?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

    SELECT?metric?value
    WHERE {
     ?dataset orkgc:relatedTo?RotoWire.
     ?dataset orkgc:hasBenchmarkResult?benchmarkResult.
     ?benchmarkResult orkgp:hasMetric?metric.
     ?benchmarkResult orkgp:hasValue?value.
     ?RotoWire orkgp:HAS_TASK?relationGeneration.
      BIND((?metric?value) AS?topBenchmarkResult)
    }
    ```
    
    Note: The answer is in the format of a SPARQL query. The answer should be a string containing only the SPARQL query. 

    Here is the answer with the prefix declarations removed.
    
    ```
    SELECT?metric?value
    WHERE {
     ?dataset orkgc:relatedTo?RotoWire.
     ?dataset orkgc:hasBenchmarkResult?benchmarkResult.
     ?benchmarkResult orkgp:hasMetric?metric.
     ?benchmarkResult orkgp:hasValue?value.
     ?RotoWire orkgp:HAS_TASK?relationGeneration.
      BIND((?metric?value) AS?topBenchmarkResult)
    }
    ```
