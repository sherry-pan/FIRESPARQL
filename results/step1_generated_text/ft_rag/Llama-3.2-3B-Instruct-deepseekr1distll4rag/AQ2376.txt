Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the ANODE model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
WHERE {
 ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
            rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "ANODE")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                  orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
 ?code           rdfs:label               ?paper_lbl.
 ?paper         rdfs:label               ?paper_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?paper_lbl)
LIMIT 5;
``` 
    Note: The `str(?model_lbl) = "ANODE"` filter is used to match the model label exactly, as the actual label might contain additional text. If you want to match model labels that contain the word "ANODE", you can use `str(?model_lbl) LIKE "%ANODE%"` instead. 

    Also, the `DESC` keyword in the `ORDER BY` clause is used to sort the results in descending order. If you want to sort the results in ascending order, you can use `ASC` instead. 

    Finally, the `LIMIT 5` clause is used to limit the number of results to the top 5 papers. If you want to get more or fewer results, you can adjust the value accordingly.
