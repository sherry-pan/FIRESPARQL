Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to answer the question using the provided JSON context. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the BART model and include links to their code. So, I need to find the most relevant properties from the JSON that can help answer this.

First, I'll look through the JSON properties to see which ones relate to papers, models, and code. The JSON has a lot of properties, so I'll go through them one by one.

I see properties like "has dataset", "evaluation", "method", etc. But I'm specifically looking for things related to papers and code. Hmm, "has implementation" stands out because it might link to code. That makes sense because if a paper uses BART, their implementation details would be here.

Next, "method" is relevant because BART is a method or model used in papers. This property would indicate that the paper employed the BART model as their approach.

Then, "has benchmark" could be useful because papers often benchmark their models, and BART's performance would be a key benchmark here.

Looking further, "evaluation" is another relevant property since papers evaluate their models, and this would include how BART was evaluated in their study.

I also notice "has dataset" which might be useful if the papers used specific datasets with BART, but it's a bit less directly related to the model itself.

"implementation" is another term that directly relates to code, so that's definitely relevant.

Wait, I should make sure I'm not missing any. "has implementation" and "method" seem the most directly related. "has benchmark" and "evaluation" support the idea that BART was used and tested.

So, putting it together, the properties that best fit are "has implementation", "method", "has benchmark", and "evaluation". These would help identify papers using BART and provide links to their code or implementation details.
