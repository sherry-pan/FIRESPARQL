Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the SciERC dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:HAS_DATASET <http://orkg.org/orkg/dataset/SciERC>.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Name?title.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_ID?id.
     }<|eot_id|>
