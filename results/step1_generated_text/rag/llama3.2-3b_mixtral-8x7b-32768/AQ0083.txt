Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the WMT2014 English-German dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?dataset 
    WHERE {
       ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
       ?dataset ora:hasDataset?model.
       ?dataset wmtc2014:benchmarkOn?benchmarking.
       ?benchmarking wmtc2014:benchmarkedOn?model.
        FILTER (STR(?model) = "models" || STR(?model) = "WMT2014 English-German" || STR(?benchmarking) = "WMT2014 English-German")
    } 

    Note: The ORKG is a knowledge graph and the data is not stored in a relational database. The SPARQL query should be designed to query the ORKG data. 

    Here is the correct solution:
    SELECT?model?dataset 
    WHERE {
       ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
       ?dataset wmtc2014:benchmarkOn?benchmarking.
       ?benchmarking wmtc2014:benchmarkedOn?model.
       ?model wmtc2014:hasModel?dataset.
        FILTER (STR(?dataset) = "WMT2014 English-German")
    } 

    The final answer is the correct SPARQL query.<|eot_id|>
