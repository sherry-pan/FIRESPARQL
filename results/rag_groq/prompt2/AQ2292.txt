Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the C51 noop model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information. The context has two main sections from the ORKG RDF dump. The first part describes a research process with steps, and the second part talks about a journal article titled "validation research" with authors and a DOI link.

I'm looking for any mention of the C51 noop model. Scanning through the context, I don't see any references to "C51 noop" or any similar terms. The first section discusses steps involving NER and CRF algorithms, but not the specific model in question. The second section is about a journal article on entity knowledge extraction but doesn't mention the C51 noop model either.

Since there's no information about the C51 noop model in the provided context, I can't extract any relevant papers or code links. Therefore, the candidates list for both "C51 noop model" and "code" will be empty.

The context provided does not contain any information related to the "C51 noop model" or any associated papers and code links. Therefore, no relevant candidates can be extracted.
