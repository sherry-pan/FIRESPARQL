    Note: This query is based on the provided knowledge graph schema. The schema might have changed since the query was generated. 
    The query is also based on the assumption that the highest benchmark result is the one with the highest value. If this is not the case, the query needs to be adjusted accordingly. 
    If the query does not return the correct answer, it is recommended to verify the knowledge graph schema and the query itself. 
    If you are still having trouble, consider rephrasing the question or providing more context.
