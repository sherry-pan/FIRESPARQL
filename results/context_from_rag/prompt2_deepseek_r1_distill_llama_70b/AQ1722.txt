Okay, so I need to figure out the top performing model for the Atari 2600 Tutankham dataset based on the given context. Let me start by looking through the provided ORKG RDF data.

First, I see that there are two main resources mentioned: R147652 and R284316, R147244, etc. R147652 has several steps described, which seem to outline a method involving NER and some algorithms like CRF. The steps mention seed terms, expansion, annotation, applying NER, and filtering. The scores mentioned are 93.9, which is linked to R147244. 

Looking at R284316, it's about a journal article discussing entity extraction using models like Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL. They mention datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP, but not Atari 2600 Tutankham. 

The other resources (R147246, R284317) list authors and venues but don't directly mention models or datasets related to Atari. 

Since the question is about the Atari 2600 Tutankham dataset, I don't see any direct mentions of this dataset in the provided context. The context talks about datasets like MNIST, AIDA, MEANTIME, etc., but not Atari. Similarly, models mentioned are SVM, CRF, Stanford NER, etc., but none specific to Atari games.

Therefore, based on the given context, there's no information about models benchmarked on the Atari 2600 Tutankham dataset. The top score of 93.9 is related to R147244, but it's not tied to a specific model or dataset in the context provided. 

So, the answer is that there's no relevant model or dataset in the provided context that matches the query.

The provided context does not contain information about models benchmarked on the Atari 2600 Tutankham dataset. Therefore, there are no relevant candidates to list.
