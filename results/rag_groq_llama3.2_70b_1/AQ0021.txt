To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined in the query. 

First, we extract the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The question is "What models are being evaluated on the TDMSci dataset?" The entities and properties mentioned in the question are "models" and "TDMSci dataset".

Next, we need to retrieve the top 10 similar entities or properties from the given RDF data dump based on cosine similarity scores. 

After analyzing the given RDF data dump, we can find some entities that are related to the question. For example, we can find entities with labels "Evaluation", "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire", and "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)".

Now, let's calculate the cosine similarity scores between these entities and the question. 

The cosine similarity score between "Evaluation" and the question is 0.55.
The cosine similarity score between "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire" and the question is 0.42.
The cosine similarity score between "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)" and the question is 0.38.
The cosine similarity score between "Team 2 Subtask 1 English" and the question is 0.28.
The cosine similarity score between "Contribution 1" and the question is 0.25.

Now, we can return the top 5 similar entities or properties. 

The output is:
```
