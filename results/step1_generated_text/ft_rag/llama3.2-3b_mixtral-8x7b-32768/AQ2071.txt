Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the FG fine-grained gate model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?code
WHERE {
 ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
            rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "FG fine-grained gate model")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK      ?model;
                  orkgp:P31               ?pred.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK      ?benchmark;
                  orkgp:HAS_CODE         ?code.
}
```sparql
    The final answer is not a number. However, I can provide the final SPARQL query that can be used to answer the given question. The query is provided above. 

Note: The provided SPARQL query is based on the given context and the input question. It is designed to query the ORKG and retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 

Also, note that the provided SPARQL query assumes that the entities and properties mentioned in the question are correctly linked in the ORKG. If the entities and properties are not correctly linked, the query may not produce the correct results. 

Therefore, it is recommended to verify the correctness of the entities and properties before running the query. 

If you have any further questions or need any clarification, please let me know. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{None}$
