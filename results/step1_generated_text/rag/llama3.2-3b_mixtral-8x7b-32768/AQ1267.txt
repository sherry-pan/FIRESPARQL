Question:
What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the Atari 2600 Double Dunk dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.io/ontology#>
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkg.io/ontology#>
     PREFIX orkgc: <http://orkg.io/ontology#>
     SELECT?benchmarkResult?metric?value
     WHERE {
   ?dataset orkgc:hasResource?resource.
   ?resource orkgc:hasDataset?dataset.
   ?dataset orkggc:hasBenchmarkResult?benchmarkResult.
   ?benchmarkResult orkggp:hasMetric?metric.
   ?benchmarkResult orkggp:hasValue?value.
    FILTER (str(?benchmarkResult) = "highest")
    }
    Note: The provided SPARQL query is based on the assumption that the dataset, benchmark result, metric, and value are all represented as resources in the ORKG. Also, it is assumed that the 'highest' benchmark result is represented as a string. 

    To generate the SPARQL query based on the provided input question and context, please follow these steps:
    1. Identify the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    2. Match the entities and properties with the corresponding entities and properties in the context.
    3. Construct the SPARQL query based on the matched entities and properties.
    4. Ensure that the SPARQL query is valid and correctly represents the intent of the input question.

    Here is the step-by-step solution to generate the SPARQL query:

    Step 1: Identify the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    The entities and properties mentioned in the question are:
    - Entity 1: Atari 2600 Double Dunk dataset
    - Entity 2: highest benchmark result
    - Entity 3: metric
    - Entity 4: value

    Step 2: Match the entities and properties with the corresponding entities and properties in the context.
    The matched entities and properties are:
    - Entity 1: orkg:R122689 (Atari 2600 Double Dunk dataset)
    - Entity 2: orkggp:HAS_BENCHMARK_RESULT (highest benchmark result)
    - Entity 3: orkggp:HAS_METRIC (metric)
    - Entity 4: orkggp:HAS_VALUE (value)

    Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query based on the matched entities and properties.
    The constructed SPARQL query is as follows:
    SELECT?benchmarkResult?metric?value
    WHERE {
   ?dataset orkgc:hasResource?resource.
