Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The query is asking for the precision, recall, and F1 values of studies that used Naive Bayes with the Bag of Words feature to classify user feedback as feature requests.

First, I'll look through the context data. The context has two main sections, each with RDF triples. The first section describes a resource R147652, which outlines a method involving steps like seed terms, expansion, annotation, NER, and filtering. The second section describes R284316 and R284317, which seem to be about a research article on entity knowledge extraction using models like jpark, and mentions authors and venues.

I need to extract relevant terms from the query. The key entities are "precision", "recall", "F1 values", "Naive Bayes", "Bag of Words", and "classify user feedback as feature request". 

Looking at the context, I see that R147652 has steps involving NER and CRF algorithms, but nothing about Naive Bayes or Bag of Words. R284316 discusses jpark, Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL, but again, no mention of Naive Bayes or specific metrics like precision or recall.

Since the context doesn't provide specific values for these metrics when using Naive Bayes and Bag of Words, I can't retrieve any relevant candidates. Therefore, the candidates for each extracted term will be empty.
