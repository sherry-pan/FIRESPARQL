Question:
What models are being evaluated on the MedSTS dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model a ora:Model.
 ?model ora:evaluatedOn?dataset.
  FILTER (STR(?dataset) = "MedSTS" || EXISTS ({?dataset a ora:Dataset.?dataset ora:hasDataset?m.?m ora:label?model })))
}
``` 
    Note: The output is a SPARQL query that can be executed on the ORKG. The query is designed to retrieve the models that are being evaluated on the MedSTS dataset. The query uses the `ora:Model`, `ora:evaluatedOn`, and `ora:Dataset` predicates from the ORKG. The `FILTER` clause is used to account for the lack of direct mention of "MedSTS" in the context. Instead, it checks if the dataset is either "MedSTS" or if it has a dataset with the label "MedSTS". The `EXISTS` function is used to check if the dataset has a corresponding model. 

    Please note that this output is based on the provided context and may need adjustments if the actual RDF data is different.

    The final answer is the provided SPARQL query.<|eot_id|>
