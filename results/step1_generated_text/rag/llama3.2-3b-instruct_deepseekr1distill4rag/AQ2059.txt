Question:
List the code links in papers that use the DrQA model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?p?o?v
WHERE {
 ?p orkp:P26?o.
 ?o a orkg:Paper.
 ?o orkp:P27?v.
 ?v orkp:P26?o.
 ?o orkg:codeLink?c.
 ?c orkp:P26?o.
  FILTER (STR(?v) = "DrQA_model")
}
```    Note: The SPARQL query is based on the provided context and the extracted terms. The actual query might need to be adjusted based on the specific RDF data dump and the ORKG schema. 

    The query is designed to find papers that use the DrQA model in any benchmark, and have code links associated with them. The query uses the `orkgp:P26` property to link papers to benchmarks, and the `orkgp:codeLink` property to link papers to code links. The `FILTER` clause is used to narrow down the results to papers that use the DrQA model. 

    Note that this query is based on the provided context and the extracted terms, and the actual query might need to be adjusted based on the specific RDF data dump and the ORKG schema. 

    The query can be executed against the ORKG RDF data dump to retrieve the desired results. 

    The query uses the following predicates:

    - `orkgp:P26`: used to link papers to benchmarks
    - `orkgp:codeLink`: used to link papers to code links
    - `orkgp:P27`: used to link papers to models
    - `orkgp:P26`: used to link papers to benchmarks
    - `orkgp:codeLink`: used to link papers to code links

    The query also uses the following filters:

    - `FILTER (STR(?v) = "DrQA_model")`: filters the results to papers that use the DrQA model. 

    The query is designed to retrieve the following information:

    - The code links associated with papers that use the DrQA model in any benchmark.

    The query can be executed against the ORKG RDF data dump to retrieve the desired results. 

    The query uses the following variables:

    - `?p`: the property being queried
    - `?o`: the object being queried
    - `?v`: the value being queried

    The query is designed to retrieve the following information:

    - The code links associated with papers that use the DrQA model in any benchmark.

    The query can be executed against the ORKG RDF data dump to retrieve the desired results. 

    The query uses the following prefixes:

    - `orkg:`: the prefix for the ORKG schema
    - `orkp:`: the prefix for the ORKP schema
    - `orkgp:`: the prefix for the ORKGP schema

    The query is designed to retrieve the following information:

    - The code links associated with papers that use the DrQA model in any benchmark.
