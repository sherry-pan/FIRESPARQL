Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the C51 noop model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of the C51 noop model. Scanning through the triples, I see that the context includes information about various resources, such as R147244, R147246, R283709, and R283710. These resources have properties like HAS_VALUE, P31, HAS_VENUE, P29, P27, etc. 

I notice that R147246 and R283710 are papers or publications with authors and years. R147246 has a value of 93.9, which might be an impact factor or some metric. R283709 is a journal article with keywords like "Graph analytics, Horizon 2021, etc." 

However, I don't see any mention of the C51 noop model in the context. The context talks about methods like SVM, MNIST, SciBERT, k-means, CRF algorithms, and applications like keyphrase extraction, named entity recognition, and graph analytics. 

Since the C51 noop model isn't present in the provided data, I can't extract any relevant papers or code links from it. Therefore, the answer should indicate that there's no relevant information available based on the context provided.
