Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the STREET model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
"""
    query = """
    SELECT DISTINCT ?code
    WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P31 ?contrib.
      ?contrib orkgp:P33030 ?benchmark.
      ?benchmark orkgp:P33031 ?code.
    }
    """
    return query
<eos>
