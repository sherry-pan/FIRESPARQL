Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. The question is asking for a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Yelp Binary classification dataset. 

First, I'll break down the query to extract the relevant terms. The key entities here are "research paper titles", "IDs", "benchmarked models", and the specific dataset "Yelp Binary classification dataset". The properties involved would be relationships like "benchmarked on" or "evaluated on".

Looking at the context data, I see that there are several resources related to papers, such as R147246 and R283710, which have properties like P27 (authors), P28 (issue), P29 (year), and P31 (type). These might help in identifying the papers. 

I also notice that the context includes information about methods and datasets, like R147652, which describes a method involving SVM and MNIST. However, the Yelp dataset isn't explicitly mentioned, so I might need to infer or find related terms.

Since the Yelp Binary dataset isn't directly listed, I'll look for similar datasets or related terms. The context includes mentions of "MNIST" and "SVM", which are related to classification tasks, so maybe there are papers that discuss classification datasets.

I'll check the resources for any that mention classification or datasets. R283709 talks about "Keyphrase extraction" and "Named entity recognition", which are NLP tasks, possibly related to Yelp's text data. 

The authors associated with these papers, like Ligia Sierra and others, might have worked on papers that use the Yelp dataset. I'll list these papers as potential candidates, even if the dataset isn't explicitly named, assuming some relevance based on the context.

I'll structure the JSON output to include the extracted terms and the candidates, using the appropriate RDF prefixes for URIs and types. Each candidate will have a URI, label, and type, ensuring they're relevant to the query.

Finally, I'll make sure the JSON follows the expected format, grouping the results by the extracted terms and including the top candidates for each.
