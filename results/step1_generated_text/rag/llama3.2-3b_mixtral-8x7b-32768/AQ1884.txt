Question:
What are the most commonly used benchmark datasets for the Text Summarization research field?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?dataset
     WHERE {
   ?researchField ork:is_related_to?researchField2.
   ?researchField2 ork:has_benchmark?benchmark.
   ?benchmark ork:has_dataset?dataset.
    FILTER (STRContains(STR(?dataset), 'MPQA') OR STRContains(STR(?dataset), 'CNN/Daily Mail'))
    }
    GROUP BY?dataset
    HAVING COUNT(?dataset) > 1
    ORDER BY DESC( count(?dataset) )
    LIMIT 5

```
This is a SPARQL query, which is used to query a knowledge graph. The query is designed to find the most commonly used benchmark datasets for the Text Summarization research field. Here's a breakdown of the query:

**SELECT clause**:
```
?dataset
```
The query selects the `dataset` variable to retrieve the names of the benchmark datasets.

**WHERE clause**:
```
?researchField ork:is_related_to?researchField2.
?researchField2 ork:has_benchmark?benchmark.
?benchmark ork:has_dataset?dataset.
```
The query uses the `ork:is_related_to` relation to find the research field that the input `Text Summarization` is related to. It then uses the `ork:has_benchmark` relation to find the benchmark datasets associated with this research field. Finally, it uses the `ork:has_dataset` relation to find the datasets associated with these benchmarks.

**FILTER clause**:
```
FILTER (STRContains(STR(?dataset), 'MPQA') OR STRContains(STR(?dataset), 'CNN/Daily Mail'))
```
The query filters the results to only include datasets that contain the strings "MPQA" or "CNN/Daily Mail" in their names.

**GROUP BY and HAVING clauses**:
```
GROUP BY?dataset
HAVING COUNT(?dataset) > 1
```
The query groups the results by the `dataset` variable and only includes datasets that appear more than once in the results.

**ORDER BY clause**:
```
ORDER BY DESC( count(?dataset) )
```
The query sorts the results in descending order by the count of each dataset.

**LIMIT clause**:
```
LIMIT 5
```
The query limits the results to the top 5 most commonly used benchmark datasets.

Overall, this query is designed to find the most commonly used benchmark datasets for the Text Summarization research field by
