Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What are the metrics of evaluation over the Atari 2600 Defender dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The question is asking about "metrics of evaluation" and the dataset in question is the "Atari 2600 Defender dataset." So, the key entities here are "metrics of evaluation" and "Atari 2600 Defender dataset." The property implied is "evaluated on" or something similar that connects the dataset to the metrics.

Next, I need to look through the provided context to find similar entities or properties. Let me go through each part of the context.

Looking at the first file, I see several steps described, like using SciBERT for expansion and CRF algorithms. There are also some resources with URIs like R147652 and R147244. R147244 has a value of "93.9," which might be a metric, but it's not clear what it refers to. Then there are some resources linked to authors and publication details, like R147246, which has authors like Ligia Sierra and others, published in 2015. This doesn't seem directly related to the Atari dataset or evaluation metrics.

Moving to the second part of the context, there's a description of an analysis performed on a large dataset of projects, organizations, and deliverables. The main contribution involves keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition. There's a resource R283709 which is a journal article with various predicates like "method," "solution proposal," and "entity extraction." It also lists keywords like "Graph analytics," "Horizon 2020," "Keyphrase extraction," etc. Another resource R283710 has authors like Yuanyuan Wu and others, published in 2021.

I'm looking for mentions of "Atari 2600 Defender dataset" or any related metrics. Scanning through, I don't see any direct references to Atari or Defender. The context seems to focus more on NLP tasks, keyphrase extraction, and named entity recognition, along with some publication details.

Since the context doesn't have information about the Atari 2600 Defender dataset or specific evaluation metrics related to it, I can't find any matching entities or properties. Therefore, the candidates for both extracted terms would be empty because there's no relevant data in the provided context.

So, the JSON output should reflect that no candidates were found for either the dataset or the evaluation metrics.
