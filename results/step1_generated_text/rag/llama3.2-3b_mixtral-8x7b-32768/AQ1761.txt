Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Accuracy metric on the Amazon benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    SELECT?model?metric 
    WHERE {
   ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model_performance.
   ?model_performance orkgp:MODEL_PERFORMANCE?metric.
   ?metric orkgp:METRIC "Accuracy".
   ?metric orkgp:ACCURACY?metric_value.
   ?metric_value orkgp:RANKS?rank.
   ?rank orkgp:RANKS "1".
   ?model orkgp:HAS_DATASET orkgr:R122689.
   ?model orkgr:R122689 orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
   ?dataset orkgp:HAS_DATASET orkg:R122689.
    }
    ``` 

## Step 1: Understand the given context and question
The question is asking for the model that performed best in terms of the Accuracy metric on the Amazon benchmark dataset. The context provides information about the entities and properties mentioned in the question, including the candidates that can be linked to these entities and properties in the ORKG.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant entities and properties from the context
From the context, the relevant entities and properties are:
- Amazon benchmark dataset
- Model
- Performed best
- Accuracy metric
- Model performance
- Metric
- Accuracy
- Rank
- Has model
- Has dataset
- Has performance

## Step 3: Determine the relationships between the entities and properties
Based on the context, the relationships between the entities and properties are:
- The Amazon benchmark dataset is a dataset that has a model.
- A model has a model performance.
- A model performance has an accuracy metric.
- An accuracy metric has a metric.
- An accuracy metric has an accuracy.
- An accuracy has a rank.
- The dataset has a rank of 1 for the best model performance.

## Step 4: Construct the SPARQL query
Using the identified relationships and the relevant entities and properties, construct the SPARQL query to retrieve the model that performed best in terms of the Accuracy metric on the Amazon benchmark dataset.
