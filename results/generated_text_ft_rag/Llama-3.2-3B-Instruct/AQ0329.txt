Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the BUCC French-to-English dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "BUCC French-to-English")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                  orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?eval,
                orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?model        orkgp:P32               ?paper;
                rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?model_lbl)
``` 
    Note: This query is designed to retrieve models that have been evaluated on the specified dataset. It uses the `orkgp:HAS_DATASET` and `orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION` properties to link models to their respective datasets and evaluations. The `FILTER` clause ensures that only the "BUCC French-to-English" dataset is considered. The `SELECT` clause retrieves the model labels, and the `ORDER BY` clause sorts the results in descending order based on the model labels.<|eot_id|>
