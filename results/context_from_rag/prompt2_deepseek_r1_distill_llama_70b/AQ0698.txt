Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Can you list the metrics used to evaluate models on the TDM Tagged Corpus dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "metrics" and "TDM Tagged Corpus dataset." The action is "evaluate models on," which implies a property related to evaluation.

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a method with multiple steps, and R284316 talks about a research article on entity knowledge extraction. However, I don't see any direct mention of "TDM Tagged Corpus dataset" or specific metrics like accuracy or F1-score in the provided data. 

Since the data doesn't include the TDM dataset or specific metrics, I can't retrieve any candidates from it. Therefore, the candidates for both extracted terms will be empty. 

I'll structure the JSON response accordingly, grouping the results under each extracted term but with no candidates found.

```json
{
  "question": "Can you list the metrics used to evaluate models on the TDM Tagged Corpus dataset?",
  "extracted_terms": [
    {
      "rdfs:label": "metrics",
      "type": "Class",
      "rdf:type": "rdfs:Class"
    },
    {
      "rdfs:label": "TDM Tagged Corpus dataset",
      "uri": "orkgr:TDM_Tagged_Corpus_dataset",
      "type": "Dataset",
      "rdf:type": "orkgc:Resource"
    },
    {
      "rdfs:label": "evaluate models on",
      "type": "Property",
      "rdf:type": "orkgp:Predicate"
    }
  ],
  "candidates": {
    "metrics": [],
    "TDM Tagged Corpus dataset": [],
    "evaluate models on": []
  }
}
