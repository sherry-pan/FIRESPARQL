Which sectors are modeled as energy sectors and how often?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?sectors, COUNT(?sectors) AS freq
     WHERE {
        ?papers rdf:type orkgc:Paper.
        ?papers rdfs:label?papers_labels.
         FILTER(REGEX(?papers_labels, "energy"^^xsd:string))
        ?papers orkgp:P30 orkgp:P31?contribution.
        ?contrib orkgp:P31?sectors.
         BIND(xsd:integer(COUNT(?sectors)) AS freq)
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(freq)
     LIMIT 10<|eot_id|>
