Okay, so I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question: "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PEGASUS model for benchmarking purposes?" 

First, I'll break down the question. The user is looking for code references in papers, specifically those that used the PEGASUS model for benchmarking. So, the key elements here are code references, papers, PEGASUS model, and benchmarking.

Looking at the JSON example provided, each entry has a "property" and a "label". My task is to find properties that relate to code, benchmarking, papers, or implementations.

Starting with benchmarking, I see a property with label "has benchmark" (property: http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_BENCHMARK). That seems directly related because benchmarking is a key part of the question.

Next, the question mentions code references. The label "implementation" (http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_IMPLEMENTATION) comes to mind because implementations often involve code, which is what the user is looking for.

The user is also asking about papers. While the JSON doesn't have a direct "paper" label, "evaluation" (http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_EVALUATION) might be relevant because papers often include evaluations of models, which could mention benchmarking.

Additionally, "method" (http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_METHOD) could be useful because it might refer to the methods or models used in the papers, such as PEGASUS.

Putting it all together, these properties cover benchmarking, code implementation, evaluation (which relates to papers), and methods. They should help in identifying where PEGASUS is used for benchmarking in papers.

The most relevant properties from the JSON file that could help answer the question about finding code references in papers using the PEGASUS model for benchmarking are:

1. **HAS_BENCHMARK**: This property is directly related to benchmarking purposes, which is a key part of the question.
2. **HAS_IMPLEMENTATION**: This relates to code references, as implementations often involve code.
3. **HAS_EVALUATION**: Evaluations in papers often discuss benchmarking and could mention the PEGASUS model.
4. **HAS_METHOD**: This refers to the methods or models used, such as PEGASUS.

These properties collectively address benchmarking, code, and paper evaluations, making them relevant to the query.
