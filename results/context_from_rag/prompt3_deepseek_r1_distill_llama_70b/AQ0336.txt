Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of models tested on the NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only) benchmark dataset. 

First, I'll look through the context information to find any relevant data. The context has several RDF triples. I see that there are resources like R147652, which describes a method involving steps like using seed terms, expanding with SciBERT, annotating entities, applying NER with CRF, and filtering. There's also information about projects, organizations, and deliverables, but that seems more about the analysis than specific models or datasets.

Looking further, I see R147246, which has authors and a year, 2015, and R283709 and R283710, which are about a journal article from 2021 with keywords like Graph analytics, Horizon 2020, Keyphrase extraction, etc. The methods mentioned include keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition models.

I need to extract terms from the question. The key entities are "models" and "NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only) benchmark dataset". The property is "tested on". 

Now, I'll search the context for these terms. The context doesn't explicitly mention "NLP-TDMS" or "arXiv", so I might need to look for related concepts. I see mentions of "benchmark" in R283709, which is a journal article. Also, R147652's steps involve models like SVM and datasets like MNIST, but those are examples, not the specific dataset in the question.

Since the exact dataset isn't present, I'll consider related resources. R283709 is about entity extraction and graph analytics, which might be relevant. R147652's method could be a model, so I'll include that. There's also a mention of CRF algorithms, which is a model type.

For properties, "tested on" would relate to evaluation, so I'll look for predicates like P39020, which describes steps, and maybe others that indicate evaluation or application.

I'll compile the candidates, making sure to use the correct prefixes. Since the exact dataset isn't found, I'll include the closest related resources and properties from the context.
