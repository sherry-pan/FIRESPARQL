Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the query using the provided context. The question is asking to list the code links in papers that use the BiT-M model in any benchmark. 

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities are "BiT-M model" and "code links." The property here is "use" as in papers that use the model.

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a method involving NER and CRF algorithms. R147244 has a value of 93.9, which might be an accuracy score. R283709 is a journal article with various predicates like "method" and "solution proposal." It also mentions "Named entity recognition" and "Graph analytics."

I need to find entities similar to "BiT-M model." In the context, there are mentions of models like "SVM" and datasets like "MNIST." Since BiT-M isn't directly mentioned, I'll look for related models or methods. R283709 talks about "method" and "solution proposal," which might be related.

For "code links," I'm looking for properties that connect papers to their code. In the context, I see predicates like P27 (authors), P28 (year), P29 (venue), HAS_VENUE, etc. There's also P5044 which is "Journal Article." However, there's no direct mention of code links, so I might need to infer based on available predicates.

I'll structure the JSON output as per the example. For "BiT-M model," I'll include resources that are models or methods. For "code links," I'll use any relevant predicates that could link to code, even if it's not explicit in the context.

I'll make sure to use the correct prefixes: "orkgr:" for resources, "orkgp:" for properties, etc. Each candidate should have a URI, label, and type.

I'll list the top 5 candidates for each extracted term, even if some are placeholders since the exact data isn't present.
