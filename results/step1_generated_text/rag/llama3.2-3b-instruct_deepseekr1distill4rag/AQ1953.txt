WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:utilized?model.
 ?model rdfs:label?modelLabel.
 ?paper ora:hasURL?url.
 ?url rdfs:label?urlLabel.
  BIND(strcat(?modelLabel, " (",?paperLabel, ")")) AS?modelPaperLabel.
  BIND(strcat(?urlLabel, " (",?paperLabel, ")")) AS?urlPaperLabel.
  FILTER(LANG(?paperLabel) = 'en' || LANG(?modelLabel) = 'en' || LANG(?urlLabel) = 'en' )
}
