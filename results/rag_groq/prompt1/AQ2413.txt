Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given ORKG RDF data dump. The query is asking for a list of papers that have used the CvT-21 (384 res) model and include links to their code. 

First, I should extract the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The main entity here is "CvT-21 (384 res) model" and the properties would be "papers that have utilized" and "links to their code." 

Next, I need to look through the provided context to find similar entities or properties. The context has several resources labeled as "Paper" and some as "Contribution" or "Evaluation." I should focus on those that are papers and see if any mention the CvT-21 model or similar terms.

Looking through the context, I see papers like "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire," "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)," and others. However, none of these explicitly mention the CvT-21 model. 

Since the context doesn't have any direct mentions of the CvT-21 model, I might need to look for papers that discuss similar topics, like computer vision models or transformer-based architectures, which could be related. But in the given data, I don't see any such references.

Therefore, based on the provided context, there are no papers that match the criteria of using the CvT-21 model. The top similar entities are other papers, but none are relevant to the specific model mentioned in the query.

The query seeks papers using the CvT-21 model, but the provided context doesn't mention this model. Here are the top 5 similar entities based on the context:
