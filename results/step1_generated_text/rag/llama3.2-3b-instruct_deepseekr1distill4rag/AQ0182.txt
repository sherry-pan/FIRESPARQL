Question:
What models are being evaluated on the NCBI-disease dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
     PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
     SELECT?model?dataset
     WHERE {
    ?model orkgc:is_a orkgr:Model.
    ?model orkgc:has_property orkgp:Evaluation_Measurement.
    ?dataset orkgc:has_property orkgp:Evaluation_Measurement.
    ?model orkgp:Evaluation_Measurement?dataset.
     SERVICE orkgr:Dataset_Sparql_Solver {
    ?dataset orkgr:label?datasetLabel.
    ?dataset orkgr:uri?datasetURI.
     FILTER (STRLIKE(?datasetLabel, "AIDA" ) OR STRLIKE(?datasetLabel, "MEANTIME" ) OR STRLIKE(?datasetLabel, "TAC-KBP" ))
     FILTER (STRLIKE(?datasetURI, "orkgr:")).
     } 
     } 

    Note: The SPARQL query is not perfect and might need further refinement based on the actual data and desired results. This query is intended to serve as a starting point. 

    The query is based on the assumption that the "Evaluation_Measurement" property is the one that is being evaluated on the ncBI-disease dataset. This is an assumption, as the actual property name may be different. The query also assumes that the dataset labels and URIs can be used to filter the results. 

    Further refinement may be needed to improve the query's accuracy and relevance. 

    The query is also based on the assumption that the "ncBI-disease dataset" is not present in the context, but rather the models are being evaluated on similar datasets. This may not be accurate, and further refinement may be needed to reflect the actual relationship between the models and the dataset.
