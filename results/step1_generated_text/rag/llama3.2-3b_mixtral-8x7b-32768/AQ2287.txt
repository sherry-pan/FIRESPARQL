Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Pointer + Coverage + EntailmentGen + QuestionGen model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql

    You can assume the following information:
    - The Pointer + Coverage + EntailmentGen + QuestionGen model is represented by the URI "http://example.org/orkgr/R44242".
    - The papers that have used the Pointer + Coverage + EntailmentGen + QuestionGen model are represented by URIs that start with "http://example.org/orkgr/R147246".
    - The code references are represented by the URI "http://example.org/orkgp/HAS_CODE".
    - The benchmarking purposes are represented by the URI "http://example.org/orkgp/HAS_BENCHMARK".
    - The label for the Pointer + Coverage + EntailmentGen + QuestionGen model is "Pointer + Coverage + EntailmentGen + QuestionGen".
    - The label for the papers is "Contribution 1".
