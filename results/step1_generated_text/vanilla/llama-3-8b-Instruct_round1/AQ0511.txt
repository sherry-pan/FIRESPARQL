Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the STS Benchmark dataset?

     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
      ?paper a orkg:ResearchPaper.
      ?paper orkg:hasTitle?title.
      ?paper orkg:hasId?id.
      ?paper stsb:performedBenchmarkOn stsb:STS_Benchmark.
     }<|eot_id|>
