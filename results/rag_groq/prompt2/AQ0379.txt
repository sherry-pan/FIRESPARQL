Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the NLP-TDMS dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "research papers" and "NLP-TDMS dataset". The properties involved are "benchmark" and "include".

Looking at the context, I see two main resources: R147246 and R284317. Both are papers with titles and venues. R147246 has a title related to a method involving SVM and MNIST, and R284317 is about extracting entity knowledge using jpark.

I'll compute the similarity between the extracted terms and the entities in the RDF data. "NLP-TDMS dataset" isn't directly mentioned, but R284317 discusses NLP tasks, which is close. The benchmark is mentioned in the context of evaluation methods and techniques.

So, the top candidates for "research papers" would be R147246 and R284317. For "NLP-TDMS dataset", since it's not present, I'll consider related datasets like those mentioned in the papers. The properties "benchmark" and "include" relate to how the papers use these datasets.

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their top candidates, ensuring the correct URIs and types are used.
