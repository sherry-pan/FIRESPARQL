Question:
What models are being evaluated on the FTD dataset dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
           FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "FTD")
          ?cont         orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
          ?eval         orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?cont;
                          orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
          ?model       orkgp:HAS_MODEL        ?cont.
          ?model      rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
     }    

    Note: The provided answer is just one possible SPARQL query to answer the question, and there might be other valid SPARQL queries to answer the question.
    Also, the provided answer is based on the given context and the question, and it might not cover all possible cases or edge cases.
    Therefore, the provided answer should be used with caution and might need to be adjusted based on the actual data in the ORKG.
    The answer should be used as a starting point and not as a definitive solution.
