Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the Reuters-21578 benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>

SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model orkg:relatedTo?testMethod.
 ?testMethod orkg:relatedTo?dataset.
  FILTER (STRLIKE(STR(?model), "SVM") OR STRLIKE(STR(?model), "CRF") OR STRLIKE(STR(?model), "Stanford NER") OR STRLIKE(STR(?model), "Flair NER") OR STRLIKE(STR(?model), "End-to-End Neural EL"))
 ?dataset orkg:relatedTo?benchmark.
  FILTER (STRLIKE(STR(?benchmark), "Reuters-21578"))
}
``` 
    Note that the prefixes used in the SPARQL query are fictional. You should replace them with the actual prefixes used in your RDF data dump. 

    Also, the SPARQL query uses the `STRLIKE` function to match the model names. This is a simple way to match strings, but it may not be suitable for all cases. You may want to consider using more advanced string matching techniques, such as regular expressions. 

    Finally, the SPARQL query uses the `FILTER` clause to filter the results. This clause can be used to apply complex conditions to the data. In this case, we're filtering the results to only include models that have been tested on the Reuters-21578 benchmark dataset. 

    The `?model?dataset` pattern in the `WHERE` clause is a variable pattern that matches any resource that has two properties: `model` and `dataset`. The `?testMethod` and `?benchmark` variables match any resource that has a `relatedTo` property with a specific value. The `FILTER` clause is used to apply the conditions to the data. 

    The `SELECT` clause specifies the variables that we want to retrieve from the data. In this case, we're retrieving the `model` and `dataset` variables. 

    The `WHERE` clause specifies the conditions under which we want to retrieve the data. In this case, we're retrieving the data for models that have been tested on the Reuters-21578 benchmark dataset.
