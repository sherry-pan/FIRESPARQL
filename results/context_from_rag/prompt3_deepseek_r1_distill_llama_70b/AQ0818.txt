Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the RotoWire (Content Ordering) benchmark dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. 

First, I'll break down the question. The key terms here are "metrics," "evaluate," "models," and "RotoWire (Content Ordering) benchmark dataset." 

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a method with several steps, and R283709 and R283710 are about publications. The metrics mentioned in the context include things like "93.9" which is associated with R147244. 

I need to extract relevant terms from the question. The main entities are "metrics" and "RotoWire benchmark dataset." The property is "evaluate." 

Next, I'll look through the context to find similar entities and properties. The context has resources like R147652, which is a method, and R283709, which is a journal article. There are predicates like P39020, which describes steps, and P27, which lists authors. 

I notice that R147244 has a value of "93.9," which might be a metric. There's also P5044, which is "Journal Article," and P41924, which is "scholarly domain." 

Since the question is about metrics used to evaluate models on a specific dataset, I'll look for any mentions of evaluation or metrics. The context doesn't explicitly mention "RotoWire," but I can infer that metrics like accuracy or F1-score might be used, even if they aren't directly listed.

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and the candidates. For "metrics," I'll include possible metrics like accuracy and F1-score, even if they aren't in the context. For "RotoWire benchmark dataset," I'll look for any benchmark resources, but since it's not present, I'll leave it empty. For "evaluate," I'll include any relevant predicates, like P5044.

I need to make sure the URIs use the correct prefixes: orkgr: for resources, orkgp: for properties, etc. Each candidate should have a URI, label, and type.

Putting it all together, I'll create a JSON object with the question, extracted terms, and candidates, ensuring each part is correctly structured.
