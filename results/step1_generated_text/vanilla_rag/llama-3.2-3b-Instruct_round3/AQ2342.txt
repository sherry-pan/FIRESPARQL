Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the DQNMMCe+SR model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?paper?benchmark?implementation?evaluation?method
     WHERE {
      ?paper a orkg:Paper.
      ?paper orkg:HAS_METHOD orkg:DQNMMCe+SR.
      ?paper orkg:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
      ?benchmark orkg:HAS_IMPLEMENTATION?implementation.
      ?benchmark orkg:HAS_EVALUATION?evaluation.
       FILTER (lang(?benchmark) = "en")
     }<|eot_id|>
