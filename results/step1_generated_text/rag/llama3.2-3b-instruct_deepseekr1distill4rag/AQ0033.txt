Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the Automatically labeled Medline abstracts corpus dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset 
WHERE {
 ?model rdfs:label?label.
 ?model rdfs:label "SVM".
 ?model rdfs:label "CRF".
 ?model rdfs:label?label.
 ?model a?type.
 ?type rdfs:label "Model".
 ?dataset rdfs:label?label.
 ?dataset rdfs:label "Automatically labeled Medline abstracts corpus dataset".
 ?dataset rdfs:label?label.
 ?dataset a?type.
 ?dataset a?datasetType.
 ?dataset?datasetType?datasetLabel.
 ?model orkg:has_benchmarked?dataset.
  SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "en" } 
}
``` 
    This output is based on the context provided and the explanation given. The SPARQL query is designed to find the models that have been benchmarked on the Automatically labeled Medline abstracts corpus dataset. The query first finds the models and their labels, then filters the models to only those that have been benchmarked on the specified dataset. Finally, the query uses the Wikibase service to get the labels for the results. 

    The query is based on the following assumptions:

    - The models are represented as RDF entities with a label and a type.
    - The dataset is represented as an RDF entity with a label, a type, and a dataset label.
    - The benchmarking relationship is represented by the `orkg:has_benchmarked` property.
    - The Wikibase service is used to get the labels for the results.

    The query is designed to be efficient and accurate, and it should return the correct results based on the provided context and explanation. 

    Note: The actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG RDF data dump.
