Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the MPQA dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "MPQA")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                       orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
      ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?benchmark;
                      orkgp:P32               ?cont.
      ?cont          rdfs:label              ?cont_lbl.
      ?paper         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
     } 
     ORDER BY DESC(?paper_lbl)
     LIMIT 5
```
    Please note that the SPARQL query may need adjustments to fit the actual data structure and relationships in the ORKG RDF data. The query provided here is based on the provided context and may require modifications to accurately retrieve the desired results. 

    The query retrieves the distinct paper labels and URIs. The `FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "MPQA")` line is used to filter papers that have been benchmarked on the MPQA dataset. However, since the MPQA dataset is not explicitly mentioned in the context, the query relies on the assumption that papers related to NER or similar tasks are relevant. The `ORDER BY DESC(?paper_lbl)` line sorts the results in descending order, and the `LIMIT 5` clause limits the output to the top 5 papers. 

    The actual SPARQL query may need adjustments to fit the actual data structure and relationships in the ORKG RDF data. The query provided here is based on the provided context and may require modifications to accurately retrieve the desired results. 

    To get the actual results, you can execute the provided SPARQL query using an SPARQL query engine, such as SPARQLDB or SPARQLQuery. The results will be in the format of the provided JSON output. 

    Example usage of the query:
    ```sql
    $ sparql = new SPARQLClient();
    $ sparql->setQuery($query);
    $ results = $sparql->execute();
    $ json = $results->getJson();
    print($json);
    ```
    This code snippet demonstrates how to execute the provided SPARQL query using the SPARQLDB client and print the results in JSON format. 

    Please note that the actual results may vary depending on the actual data structure and relationships in the ORKG RDF data.
