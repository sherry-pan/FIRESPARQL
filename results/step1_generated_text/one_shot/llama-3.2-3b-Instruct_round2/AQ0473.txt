Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Rotowire (Content Selection) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl?id
    WHERE {
     ?dataset        a                orkgc:Dataset;
                    rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
      FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Rotowire (Content Selection)")
     ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
     ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
     ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                    rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl;
                    orkgp:id             ?id.
    }<|eot_id|>
