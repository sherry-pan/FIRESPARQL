Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the CvT-21 (384 res) model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>

    SELECT?p?paper?code 
    WHERE {
       ?paper orkg:utilized?utilized.

       ?paper orkg:link?paperLink.
       ?paperLink orkg:url?paperUrl.
        FILTER (str(?modelVersion) = "384 res").
        BIND (CONCAT(?paperUrl,?paperLink) AS?paperLinkCode)
        BIND (str(?paperUrl) || str(?paperLinkCode) AS?paperCode)
        FILTER (str(?paperCode)!= "deleted")
        FILTER (str(?paperUrl)!= "deleted")
    }
