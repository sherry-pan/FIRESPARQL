Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the RotoWire dataset. The question is about metrics used, so I should look for properties related to evaluation, benchmarks, or performance measurement.

First, I'll scan through the list of properties. I see "evaluation" with the label "evaluation" and "has benchmark" which seems directly related to benchmarks. These are definitely relevant because they likely contain the metrics used.

Next, I notice properties like "Accuracy", "Recall", "macro-F1", and "micro-F1". These are common evaluation metrics in machine learning, so they should be included.

There's also "NDCG@10", which stands for Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at 10. This is a ranking metric, which makes sense for content ordering tasks like RotoWire.

I should also consider "has training set" and "validation set" because these are parts of the dataset used for model evaluation, even though they aren't metrics themselves.

Looking further, "Avg Characters", "Avg words", and other average metrics might provide context about the dataset's characteristics, which could be useful in understanding the evaluation setup.

I'll make sure to include all these properties as they each contribute to understanding how models are evaluated on the RotoWire benchmark.

Here is the list of relevant properties from the JSON file that could help answer the question about the metrics used to evaluate models on the RotoWire (Content Ordering) benchmark dataset:
