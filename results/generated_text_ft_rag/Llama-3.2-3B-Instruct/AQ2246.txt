Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the SAC model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
      PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
      SELECT?paper?paper_lbl (COUNT(?code) AS?code_cnt) 
      WHERE {
        orkg:P31?paper?paper_lbl.
       ?paper orkg:P5032?code.
       ?code orkg:P5033?code_lbl.
      }
      GROUP BY?paper?paper_lbl?code_lbl
      ORDER BY DESC(?code_cnt)
      LIMIT 10
    ```
    Note: The SPARQL query provided here assumes the existence of the necessary properties and their corresponding labels. The query is designed to retrieve papers, their corresponding code links, and the code link labels. The results are then grouped by paper and code link, and sorted in descending order based on the count of code links. The top 10 results are then returned. The query can be modified based on the actual structure of the ORKG data.<|eot_id|>
