Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking to list the code links in papers that use the OTF spelling+lemma (single) model in any benchmark. 

First, I'll break down the query to extract the relevant terms. The main entities here are "papers" and "OTF spelling+lemma (single) model". The property mentioned is "code links" and the context is "any benchmark".

Looking at the context data, I see that there are several resources related to papers, such as R147246 and R283710, which have authors and publication details. However, I don't see any direct mention of "OTF spelling+lemma (single) model" or "code links". 

I'll need to find similar entities or properties. Since "OTF spelling+lemma" isn't present, I'll look for related models or benchmarks. The context mentions models like "SVM" and datasets like "MNIST", but nothing about OTF. 

For "papers", I can use the existing paper resources like R147246 and R283710. For "code links", I might need to infer properties related to URLs or implementations, but the context doesn't provide specific ones. 

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and the closest matching candidates from the context. Since there's no exact match for the model, I'll include general models and papers that might be relevant.
