Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the BCN+ELMo model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT DISTINCT?code
WHERE {
 ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
            rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "BCN+ELMo")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                  orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
}
```    Note: The answer is an empty list because there is no relevant data in the ORKG to match the query.<|eot_id|>
