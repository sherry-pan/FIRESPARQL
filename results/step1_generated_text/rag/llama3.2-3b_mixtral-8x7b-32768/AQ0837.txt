Question:
What are the metrics of evaluation over the Hutter Prize dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric?evaluation 
     WHERE {
       ?dataset orkg:HAS_DATASET?dataset2.
       ?dataset orkg:RDF_TYPE orkg:Dataset.
       ?dataset2 orkg:HAS_DATASET?evaluation.
       ?evaluation orkg:HAS_METRIC?metric.
       ?metric orkg:RDF_TYPE orkg:Metric.
    } 

    Explanation: The SPARQL query is constructed by using the entities and properties provided in the context to link the input question to the correct entities and properties in the ORKG. The query first finds all datasets that have the Hutter Prize dataset as their child dataset, then it finds the evaluation metric for each of these datasets. The selected evaluation metric is then matched with the evaluation metric that has the Hutter Prize dataset as its child evaluation. Finally, the selected metric is matched with the metric that has the evaluation metric as its child metric. The selected metric and evaluation are then returned as the answer to the input question. 

    The selected metric and evaluation are then returned as the answer to the input question. 

    The query uses the following predicates:
    - orkg:RDF_TYPE (type of resource)
    - orkg:HAS_DATASET (has dataset as child)
    - orkg:HAS_EVALUATION (has evaluation metric as child)
    - orkg:HAS_METRIC (has metric as child)
    - orkg:RDF_TYPE (type of resource)
    - orkg:Metric (type of metric)
    - orkg:Evaluation (type of evaluation) 
    Note that the query is constructed based on the entities and properties provided in the context, and may not be the only possible query to answer the input question.
