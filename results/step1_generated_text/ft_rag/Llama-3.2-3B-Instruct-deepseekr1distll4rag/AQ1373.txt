Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Sequence error metric on the FSNS - Test benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
 ?metric     a       orkgc:Metric;
              rdfs:label ?metric_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?metric_lbl) = "Sequence error")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:P31               ?model.
 ?model         rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
}
ORDER BY (ASC?model_lbl)
LIMIT 1
``` 
    Note: The query is written in SPARQL 1.1 query language. It is based on the provided context and question. The query first filters the metrics to get the "Sequence error" metric. Then it retrieves the contributions associated with the filtered metrics and their respective datasets. It further filters the contributions to get the models and their labels. Finally, it orders the results by the model labels and limits the output to the top result. 

    This query should be executed on the ORKG RDF data to obtain the answer. The answer is a list of dictionaries containing the model URIs and their labels, sorted by the model labels. The top result will be the model with the best performance in terms of Sequence error on the FSNS-Test dataset. 

    The output of the query should match the provided JSON list. The SPARQL query is designed to be executed on the ORKG RDF data to provide the correct answer to the input question. 

    The SPARQL query uses the following predicates and properties:

    - `orkgp:HAS_DATASET` to get the dataset associated with a contribution
    - `orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK` to get the benchmark associated with a contribution
    - `orkgp:P31` to get the model associated with a contribution
    - `rdfs:label` to get the label of a resource
    - `str` to filter the strings (in this case, the metric labels)
    - `ASC` to sort the results by the model labels in ascending order
    - `LIMIT 1` to get the top result
