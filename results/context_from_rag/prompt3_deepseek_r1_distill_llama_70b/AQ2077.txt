Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the query using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of papers that have used the MEMEN model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "papers" and "MEMEN model". The property mentioned is "utilized" or "used".

Looking through the context, I see that there are several resources related to papers, such as R147246 and R283710, which have authors and publication details. However, I don't see any mention of the MEMEN model in the context provided. 

Since the MEMEN model isn't present, I can't find any specific papers that used it. But I can still provide the structure as per the example, noting that no candidates were found for the MEMEN model. 

I'll structure the JSON with the extracted terms and empty candidates for the MEMEN model, and include the papers found in the context under the "papers" section.

```json
{
  "question": "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the MEMEN model and include the links to their code?",
  "extracted_terms": {
    "papers": "papers",
    "MEMEN model": "MEMEN model",
    "utilized": "utilized"
  },
  "candidates": {
    "papers": [
      {
        "uri": "orkgr:R147246",

        "rdf:type": "orkgc:Resource"
      },
      {
        "uri": "orkgr:R283710",
        "rdfs:label": "Paper by Yuanyuan Wu et al.",
        "rdf:type": "orkgc:Resource"
      }
    ],
    "MEMEN model": [],
    "utilized": []
  }
}
