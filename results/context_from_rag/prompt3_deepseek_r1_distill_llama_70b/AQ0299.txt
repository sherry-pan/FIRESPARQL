Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question "What models are being evaluated on the Classic dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "models" and "Classic dataset". The property mentioned is "evaluated on". So, I need to look for these terms in the context.

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 has steps that mention models like SVM and datasets like MNIST. There's also information about NER approaches and CRF algorithms. Another resource, R283709, talks about keyphrase extraction, named entity recognition, and graph analytics. It mentions "method" and "solution proposal" as well.

I need to find entities similar to "models" and "Classic dataset". From the context, models mentioned include SVM, and datasets include MNIST. Since "Classic" isn't explicitly mentioned, I'll consider other datasets like MNIST as potential candidates. For the property "evaluated on", I can look for predicates that relate models to datasets, such as P39020 which describes steps involving evaluation.

Now, I'll retrieve the top 10 similar entities or properties. For "models", the closest matches are SVM and CRF algorithm. For "Classic dataset", since it's not present, I'll consider MNIST and other datasets mentioned. For "evaluated on", the relevant predicate is P39020.

Finally, I'll select the top 5 candidates for each extracted term. For "models", SVM and CRF are top. For "Classic dataset", MNIST is the closest. For "evaluated on", P39020 is the main predicate.

I should structure the JSON output with these candidates, using the correct RDF prefixes and types. Each candidate should have a URI, label, and type. I'll make sure the structure matches the example provided, grouping the results under each extracted term.
