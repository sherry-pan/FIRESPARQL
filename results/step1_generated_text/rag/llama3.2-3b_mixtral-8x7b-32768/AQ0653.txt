Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the SciCite dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
     PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology#>
     PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology#>
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology#>
     SELECT?researchPaper?title?ID
     WHERE {
       ?researchPaper a orkgc:Contribution.
       ?researchPaper orkgp:HAS_ID?ID.
       ?researchPaper orkgp:HAS_TITLE?title.
       ?researchPaper orkgp:HAS_DATASET orkgc:SciCiteDataset.
       ?researchPaper orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
       ?benchmark a orkgc:Benchmark.
        FILTER (str(?benchmark) = "SciCite")
        }
    ```



## Step 1: Define the prefixes for the given ontologies.
The prefixes for the given ontologies are defined as follows:
- orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology#>
- orkgc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology#>
- orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology#>

## Step 2: Select the required variables from the given context.
The required variables are:
-?researchPaper
-?title
-?ID

## Step 3: Define the conditions for the research papers.
The conditions for the research papers are:
- The research paper is a contribution.
- The research paper has an ID.
- The research paper has a title.
- The research paper is associated with the SciCite dataset.
- The research paper has performed benchmarks.

## Step 4: Filter the benchmarks to only include those related to the SciCite dataset.
The filter condition for the benchmarks is:
- The benchmark is related to the SciCite dataset.

## Step 5: Write the SPARQL query based
