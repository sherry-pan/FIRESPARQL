Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the ResNet-152 (SAM) model?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities mentioned are "ResNet-152 (SAM) model" and "papers." The action here is "benchmark," which relates to how the model is evaluated. So, the extracted terms are "ResNet-152 (SAM) model," "papers," and "benchmark."

Next, I need to compute the similarity between these terms and the entities in the RDF data. Looking at the context, I see mentions of models like SVM and datasets like MNIST, but nothing directly about ResNet-152. However, there are papers and their URLs listed. For example, there's a paper with URL "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075" which might be related to models or benchmarking.

I'll check each resource in the RDF data. R147652 describes a method involving SVM and MNIST, which isn't directly related to ResNet-152. R284316 talks about entity recognition and linking, which might be related to benchmarking but not the specific model. R284317 is a paper about knowledge extraction, which could be relevant but doesn't mention ResNet-152.

Since there's no direct mention of ResNet-152, I'll look for any related models or benchmarking techniques. The RDF data doesn't have specific entries for ResNet-152, so I'll have to consider that the model isn't present. However, there are papers that discuss benchmarking and models in general, so I can suggest those as possible sources for code, even if they don't specifically mention ResNet-152.

I'll structure the answer by grouping the extracted terms and listing the top candidates. For "ResNet-152 (SAM) model," since it's not found, I'll note that. For "papers," I'll include the ones with URLs. For "benchmark," I'll include any related resources, even if they're about other models.

Finally, I'll format the JSON output as specified, ensuring the use of correct prefixes and including the necessary types and labels.
