Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the DCASE dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/predicate/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/resource/>
    SELECT?paper?title?id
    WHERE {
       ?paper orkgc:Paper.
       ?paper orkggp:HAS_PAPER?b.
       ?b orkggp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
       ?benchmark orkgc:Dataset.
       ?benchmark orkgc:hasDataset?dataset.
       ?dataset orkgc:Dataset.
       ?dataset orkg:R122689.
       ?paper orkggp:HAS_ID?id.
       ?paper orkggp:HAS_TITLE?title.
        FILTER (str(?title)!= "")
        FILTER (str(?id)!= "")
    }
    ```sparql
    Output:

    Note: The prefix declarations are not included in the output as they are already provided in the prompt. 
    The output is the SPARQL query that can be used to query the ORKG to get the correct answer to the input question. 
    The query is based on the provided context and the extracted terms from the question. 
    It uses the predicates and resources mentioned in the context to link the correct entities or properties in the ORKG. 
    The query filters out any papers with empty titles or IDs to ensure that only valid papers are returned. 
    ```sparql
    ```sparql
    Note: The output is the SPARQL query, not the answer to the question. The answer would be the result of executing the SPARQL query on the ORKG. 
    To get the actual answer, you would need to execute the query on the ORKG and provide the result. 
    ```sparql
    ```sparql
    To clarify, the provided output is the SPARQL query that can be used to query the ORKG, not the actual answer to the question. 
    The actual answer would depend on the result of executing the query
