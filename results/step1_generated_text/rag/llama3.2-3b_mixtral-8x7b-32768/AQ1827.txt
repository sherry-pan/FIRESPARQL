Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Macro Recall metric on the NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only) benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/orkgp/>
SELECT?model?metric?dataset?bestModel
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?m.
 ?m orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
 ?metric orkgr:R122689 orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?dataset.
  FILTER(STRLIKE(STR(?metric), "Macro Recall")).
 ?bestModel orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model.
  FILTER((?metric =?bestModel) || (?model =?bestModel)).
}
```

    Note: The provided SPARQL query is already optimized for the given input question and context. It assumes that the answer to the question is one of the models that has the "Macro Recall metric" and has the best performance on the "NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only) benchmark dataset". If the answer is not among the models that have the "Macro Recall metric", the query will not return the correct result. Therefore, the query needs to be further optimized based on the actual answer to the question. 

    If the answer is among the models that have the "Macro Recall metric", the query will return the correct result. 

    If you need to optimize the query further or if you need to handle more complex scenarios, you may need to consider other factors such as the specific model names, the specific metric values, and the relationships between the entities and properties in the ORKG. 

    For example, you may need to consider the following factors:
    1. The specific model names: What are the names of the models that have the "Macro Recall metric"? Are there any other models that have the "Macro Recall metric" but are not the best performers?
    2. The specific metric values: What are the values of the "Macro Recall metric" for the models that have it?
