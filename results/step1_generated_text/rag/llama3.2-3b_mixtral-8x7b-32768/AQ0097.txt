Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the Multimodal PISA dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX ork: <http://example.org/ork/>
    SELECT?model?dataset 
    WHERE {
     ?model ork:has_model?m.
     ?m ork:has_dataset?dataset.
     ?dataset ork:MultimodalPISA.
     ?model ork:evaluatedOn?e.
     ?e ork:hasEvaluationOn?dataset.
    }
    LIMIT 1000
