Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the STL-10 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
    ?dataset orkg:CSVW_Name "STL-10".
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Titles?title.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Number?id.
     }<|eot_id|>
