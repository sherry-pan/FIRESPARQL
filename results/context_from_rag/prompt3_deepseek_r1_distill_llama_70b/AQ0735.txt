Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Penn Treebank benchmark dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "metrics" and "Penn Treebank benchmark dataset." The property mentioned is "evaluate models on," which I can interpret as "evaluated on" or "used to evaluate."

Looking at the context data, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there's a resource R147652 that describes a method involving steps like named entity recognition and using a CRF algorithm. There are also resources related to journal articles, such as R283709 and R283710, which mention things like "Graph analytics," "Named entity recognition," and "Text mining."

I need to find entities and properties related to "metrics" and "Penn Treebank." Since the context doesn't explicitly mention "Penn Treebank," I'll look for related terms. The closest I see is "MNIST" and "SVM" mentioned in Step 1 of R147652, but that's not directly relevant. 

For metrics, I recall that in NLP, common metrics include accuracy, F1-score, precision, recall, etc. However, the context doesn't list specific metrics. It does mention "93.9" as a value in R147244, which might be a metric score, but without context, it's unclear.

Looking at the predicates, P39020 describes steps, P31 is about types, HAS_VALUE, HAS_VENUE, P29 is the year, P28 might be volume, and P27 lists authors. These don't directly relate to evaluation metrics.

In the second part of the context, R283709 talks about "method," "solution proposal," "entity extraction," and keywords like "Named entity recognition." This suggests that the method involves NER, which often uses metrics like F1-score.

Since the context doesn't provide explicit metrics or a direct link to Penn Treebank, I'll have to infer based on common practices. For the Penn Treebank, typical metrics might include perplexity, accuracy, or F1-score for parsing tasks.

So, I'll structure the answer by extracting "metrics" and "Penn Treebank benchmark dataset" as terms. For each, I'll list possible candidates. For "metrics," I'll include general ones like accuracy and F1-score, and for "Penn Treebank," I'll look for any related resources, even if they're not explicitly mentioned.

I'll format the JSON as specified, using the correct prefixes and including types. Since the context doesn't have exact matches, the candidates will be based on related concepts and common metrics used in NLP tasks.
