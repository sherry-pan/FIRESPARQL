Okay, I need to figure out which model has the highest BLEU score on the WMT2016 Romanian-English benchmark dataset. Let me start by breaking down the question.

First, the key terms here are "model," "BLEU score," and "WMT2016 Romanian-English benchmark dataset." I should look for these in the provided context.

Looking through the context, I see several resources. R147652 describes a method with steps, but I don't see any BLEU scores there. R147244 has a value of "93.9," but it's not clear what that refers to. R284316 talks about a journal article on entity knowledge extraction, but again, no mention of BLEU scores.

Wait, maybe the BLEU score is mentioned elsewhere. Let me check again. Hmm, I don't see any specific mentions of BLEU scores in the context provided. That's a problem because without that information, I can't determine which model achieved the highest score.

Perhaps the context is limited, and the necessary data isn't included. In that case, I can't provide an accurate answer based on the given information. I might need to look for additional data or sources that include BLEU scores for models on the WMT2016 dataset.

Since the context doesn't have the required details, I can't extract the relevant terms or compute similarity scores. Therefore, I can't generate the expected JSON output with the top candidates.

The provided context does not contain information about BLEU scores or the WMT2016 Romanian-English benchmark dataset. Therefore, it's impossible to determine the model with the highest BLEU score based on the given data.

```json
