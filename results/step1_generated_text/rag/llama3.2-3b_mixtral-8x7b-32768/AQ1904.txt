Question:
Provide a list of benchmarked datasets related to the Scientific Results Extraction research area?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql

    Note: The provided SPARQL query is not the only possible query to solve the problem, but it is one of the correct SPARQL queries to solve the problem. There may be other possible SPARQL queries that also solve the problem.

    This problem is designed to test your ability to generate a SPARQL query from a natural language question, given a provided context, and to understand the relationships between entities and properties in the ORKG. 

    The goal of this task is to generate a SPARQL query that retrieves the correct answer to the input question. The query should be able to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question. 

    You can use the provided context as background information for linking the correct entities or properties in the ORKG. 

    The context includes the following information:
    1. Terms (entities and properties) mentioned in the question.
    2. Candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.

    You are required to generate the SPARQL query based on the provided context. 

    You should not use any external knowledge or resources other than the provided context. 

    You can use the provided context to infer the correct entities and properties in the
