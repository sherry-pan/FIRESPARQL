Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the MEMEN (single model) model?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper       a            orkgc:Paper;
                  rdfs:label   ?paper_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?paper_lbl) = "MEMEN (single model)")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE     ?code.
      ?code           rdfs:label               ?code_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?code_lbl) = "code")
     }    ```
    Please note that the above query was provided as an example and should be adjusted according to the actual dataset and question. This is not a solution to your problem but an example of how the query should look like. To solve the problem, you need to replace the dataset name, paper labels and code labels with the actual values from your dataset. 

    The query works as follows:
    1. It selects all papers that have the label "MEMEN (single model)".
    2. For each of these papers, it selects all datasets that it belongs to.
    3. For each dataset, it selects all source codes that belong to it.
    4. For each source code, it selects its label.
    5. It filters the results to only include source codes labeled "code". 

    You may need to adjust the query according to your specific needs. For example, you may need to add more filters or select different values. 

    Please replace the values in the query with the actual values from your dataset. 

    Note: The dataset used for this example is the ORKG dataset, which can be downloaded from the ORKG website. The dataset is a graph of scholarly contributions and their relationships. It contains information about papers, authors, conferences, and more. The dataset is designed to be used for research and comparison of different machine learning models.
