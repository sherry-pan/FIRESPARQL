Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the CUB-200-2011 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?researchPaper.
 ?researchPaper orkgp:INCLUDES?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?dataset.
 ?dataset rdfs:label?datasetLabel.
  FILTER (?datasetLabel = "CUB-200-2011"^^xsd:string).
 ?paper orkgc:hasTitle?title.
 ?paper orkgc:hasID?id.
  FILTER (?title!= "" AND?id!= "")
}
```


    Note that the actual URIs in the SPARQL query may vary based on the actual structure of the ORKG.
    You should assume that the URIs in the SPARQL query are correct and functional. 

    The SPARQL query is based on the provided context and question. It selects all the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the CUB-200-2011 dataset. The query first identifies the research papers that include a benchmark, then filters the results to only include papers that include the CUB-200-2011 dataset as a benchmark. Finally, it selects the titles and IDs of the qualifying papers. 

    The `FILTER` clauses are used to ensure that the results are only returned for papers with non-empty titles and IDs. 

    Please note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG. 

    This response should be in the following format:
