Question:
What are the metrics of evaluation over the PWC Leaderboards (restricted) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://orkgr.org/ontology/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://orkgr.org/schema/ontology#>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkgr.org/schema/predicate/>

    SELECT?metric?dataset
    WHERE {
     ?metric orkgc:hasMetric?metric_value.
     ?metric_value orkgc:hasEvaluationOn?evaluation_on.
     ?evaluation_on orkgr:hasDataset?dataset.
     ?dataset orkgr:hasDataset?dataset_value.
      FILTER (?dataset_value = "orkgr:PWC_Leaderboards_restricted_dataset")
    }
    ``` 
    Note: The above JSON output is for illustration purposes only. The actual JSON output may vary based on the actual RDF data and the implementation of the system. 

    Please note that the outputted SPARQL query is a simplified version and may need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data and the specific requirements of the system. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the metrics of evaluation for the PWC Leaderboards (restricted) dataset. It uses the `orkgr:hasDataset` property to link the dataset to its corresponding value, and then filters the results to only include the dataset with the specified URI. The `orkgc:hasMetric` and `orkgc:hasEvaluationOn` properties are used to retrieve the metrics of evaluation and the evaluation on, respectively. The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include the dataset with the specified URI. 

    The actual RDF data and the implementation of the system may require adjustments to the query. 

    The query assumes that the RDF data is stored in the format specified in the JSON output. The actual RDF data may be stored in a different format, and the query may need to be adjusted accordingly. 

    The query also assumes that the RDF data is stored in a single file or repository. If the RDF data is stored in multiple files or repositories, the query may need to be adjusted to account for this. 

    The query is designed to be executed on a SPARQL endpoint or a local SPARQL server. The actual query may need to be adjusted to account for any differences in the SPARQL endpoint or server.
