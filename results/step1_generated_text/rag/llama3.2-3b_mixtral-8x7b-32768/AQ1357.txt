Question:
Can you provide the highest benchmark result, including the metric and score, for the BUCC German-to-English dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/orkgr/>

SELECT?dataset?metric?score
WHERE {
 ?dataset orkgp:HAS_DATASET orkgr:R122689.
 ?dataset orkgp:HAS_BEST_RESULT?result.
 ?result orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
 ?result orkgp:HAS_SCORE?score.
  FILTER (lang(?metric) = "en" AND lang(?score) = "en" )
}
``` 
    The best answer is the one that corresponds to the generated SPARQL query. 

    Note that the actual SPARQL query might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the data in the ORKG.
