Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WebQuestions dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WebQuestions")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
      ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont.
      ?paper         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
     }     ORDER BY?paper_lbl ASC
    NOTE: The answer to this question should be a list of tuples where the first element of each tuple is the title of the paper and the second element is the paper's ID. The answer should be sorted alphabetically by paper title.<|eot_id|>
