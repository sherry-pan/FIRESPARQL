Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the query: "Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "research paper titles and IDs" and "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset". The action is "have benchmarked models on", which implies a relationship between papers and the dataset.

Looking at the context information, I see two main resources: R147246 and R284316. R147246 has a lot of steps related to a method, and R284316 is a journal article about extracting entity knowledge from text. 

I need to find which of these papers are benchmarked on the Penn Treebank dataset. Since the context doesn't explicitly mention "Penn Treebank", I'll have to infer based on the datasets mentioned. R147246 mentions MNIST, which is a different dataset, so it might not be relevant. R284316 talks about using datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP, which also don't include Penn Treebank.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. The user's question is about benchmarking on Penn Treebank, but the provided data doesn't have that. So perhaps the answer is that there are no papers in the given data that match this criterion. Alternatively, maybe I should consider that the context doesn't provide the necessary information, so the answer can't be determined from the given data.

But the user expects a JSON output with candidates. Since there's no direct mention, I might have to structure the answer as such, indicating that no relevant papers were found in the provided context.

To answer the query "Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset?", we need to extract relevant terms and find matching entities in the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

### Extracted Terms:
1. **Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset**
2. **Research paper titles and IDs**
3. **Benchmarked models on**

### Similarity Calculation:
After analyzing the context, the provided data does not contain any information related to the Penn Treebank dataset or benchmarked models on it. Therefore, no relevant candidates can be identified.

### JSON Output:

```json
{
  "question": "Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset?",
  "extracted_terms": [
    {
      "rdfs:label": "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset",
      "uri": "orkgr:Penn_Treebank_Character_Level_dataset",
      "type": "Dataset",
      "rdf:type": "orkgc:Resource"
    },
    {
      "rdfs:label": "research paper titles and IDs",
      "type": "Research Paper",
      "rdf:type": "orkgc:Resource"
    },
    {
      "rdfs:label": "benchmarked models on",
      "type": "Property",
      "rdf:type": "orkgp:Predicate"
    }
  ],
  "candidates": {
    "Penn Treebank (Character Level) dataset": [],
    "research paper titles and IDs": [],
    "benchmarked models on": []
  }
}
```

This response indicates that no relevant entities or properties were found in the provided data that match the query criteria.
