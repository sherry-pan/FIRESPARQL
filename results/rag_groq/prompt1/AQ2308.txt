Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given context. The query is asking for a list of papers that used the A3C FF hs model and include links to their code. But looking at the context provided, I don't see any mention of the A3C FF hs model or any code links. The context has information about various resources like papers, evaluations, and materials, but none related to the specific model mentioned.

First, I should extract the entities and properties from the question. The main entity here is "A3C FF hs model" and the properties are "papers that have utilized" and "links to their code." 

Next, I need to look through the provided ORKG data to find similar entities or properties. However, scanning through the context, I don't find any resources that mention the A3C FF hs model. The papers listed are about topics like Nested Named Entity Recognition, Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology, and others, but none related to the A3C model.

Since there's no relevant information in the context, I can't retrieve any similar entities or properties. Therefore, the top 5 similar candidates would be an empty list because there's no matching data.

The query seeks papers using the A3C FF hs model with code links, but the context lacks any relevant information. Thus, no similar entities are found.
