Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given ORKG RDF data. The query is asking for links to code used in papers that benchmark the BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo (ensemble) model. 

First, I should extract the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The main entities here are "BiDAF", "Self Attention", "ELMo", and the action is benchmarking. So I'm looking for resources related to these models and their benchmarking.

Looking through the context, I see several resources. R76244 is labeled "Team 2 Subtask 1 English" and is a Contribution. R75430 is a Venue labeled "IBM Journal of Research and Development". R75431 is another Contribution called "Contribution 1". R75840 is a Comparison about factors in humanitarian response, which might not be relevant. R75841 is a Paper but the label isn't provided. 

R76205's label is about predicting absolute similarity ratings. R76206 is "Uncentered pearson correlation", which is a statistical method. R76218 and R76224 are components for a template. R76227 and R76228 are about predicting changes in human similarity ratings. R76255 mentions datasets like WiC and performance in Subtask1. R76416 is a Paper titled "CIRCE at SemEval-2020 Task 1...", which involves word representations.

Now, I need to find the top 5 similar entities. The question is about code links for benchmarking a specific model ensemble. So I look for resources related to benchmarking, contributions, papers, and specific models or tasks.

R76244 seems relevant as it's a Contribution and part of a subtask. R75430 is a Venue, which might host relevant papers. R75431 is another Contribution. R76255 talks about datasets and performance, which could relate to benchmarking. R76416 is a Paper about word representations, which might use similar models.

I'll list these as the top 5, assigning scores based on relevance. Since the exact similarity scores aren't provided, I'll assign them in descending order of relevance.

To address the query about code links for benchmarking the BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo ensemble, I identified the top 5 relevant entities from the ORKG data. These were selected based on their relation to benchmarking, contributions, and relevant papers.
