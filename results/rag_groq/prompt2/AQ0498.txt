Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the query: "Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WikiText-2 dataset?" using the given ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the ORKG data is in Turtle format, and I have two files here. I need to extract relevant terms from the query. The question is about research papers that have benchmarked models on the WikiText-2 dataset. So, the key entities here are "research papers," "benchmark models," and "WikiText-2 dataset."

Looking at the provided context, I see that there are two main resources: R147246 and R284317. Both seem to be research papers. R147246 has a bunch of authors and some properties like P27, p27, etc. R284317 also has authors and a URL. 

I need to find which of these papers have benchmarked models on WikiText-2. Wait, but in the context, I don't see any direct mention of WikiText-2. Hmm, maybe I'm missing something. Let me check again.

Looking at R147246, the properties include P27, which is the number 6, and P29 as 2015. The paper's title isn't directly given, but the authors are listed. The other resource, R284317, has a URL and a DOI, which might be useful. 

Wait, maybe the benchmarking is implied through the methods used. For example, R147246 uses a CRF algorithm, and R284317 talks about NER and entity linking. But without explicit mention of WikiText-2, it's tricky. 

Perhaps I should consider that the context doesn't have the specific dataset mentioned, so the answer might be that there are no papers in the provided data that benchmark on WikiText-2. But that seems odd. Alternatively, maybe I'm supposed to infer based on the methods used, but I'm not sure.

I think the correct approach is to state that based on the provided data, there's no explicit mention of the WikiText-2 dataset. Therefore, no papers can be listed from this data. But I'm not entirely sure if I'm missing something here.

To answer the query "Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WikiText-2 dataset?" based on the provided ORKG RDF data dump, we need to follow the outlined steps:

1. **Extract Relevant Terms**: The key entities in the query are "research papers," "benchmark models," and "WikiText-2 dataset."

2. **Analyze the Context**: The provided context includes two research papers (R147246 and R284317). However, neither of these papers explicitly mentions the WikiText-2 dataset. 

3. **Conclusion**: Since there is no mention of the WikiText-2 dataset in the provided data, we cannot identify any research papers that benchmark models on this dataset.

**Answer**: 

```json
{
  "question": "Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WikiText-2 dataset?",
  "extracted_terms": [
    {
      "rdfs:label": "research papers",
      "uri": "orkgr:research_papers",
      "type": "Research Paper",
      "rdf:type": "orkgc:Resource"
    },
    {
      "rdfs:label": "benchmark models",
      "uri": "orkgr:benchmark_models",
      "type": "Benchmark",
      "rdf:type": "orkgc:Resource"
    },
    {
      "rdfs:label": "WikiText-2 dataset",
      "uri": "orkgr:WikiText-2_dataset",
      "type": "Dataset",
      "rdf:type": "orkgc:Resource"
    }
  ],
  "candidates": {
    "research papers": [],
    "benchmark models": [],
    "WikiText-2 dataset": []
  }
}
```

This JSON object indicates that no relevant research papers or benchmark models related to the WikiText-2 dataset were found in the provided data.
