Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the SEE model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?code
WHERE {
 ?benchmark      a            orkgc:Comparison;
                  rdfs:label   ?benchmark_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?benchmark_lbl) = "benchmark the SEE model")
 ?cont         orkgp:P31      ?benchmark.
 ?paper        orkgp:P32      ?cont.
 ?code         orkgp:HAS_CODE   ?cont.
}
``` 
    The above code is a SPARQL query that will return the code links used in papers that benchmark the SEE model. The query follows the steps outlined in the provided context. It filters resources that mention "benchmark the SEE model", then selects resources that are papers or contributions, and finally selects the code links from those resources. The result will be a list of code links used in papers that benchmark the SEE model. 

    To execute this query, you can use a SPARQL query engine like SPARQLDB or a web-based interface like SPARQL Query Console. 

    Please note that the above code is based on the provided context and RDF data, and the actual query may need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data and the query engine being used. 

    Also, the context provided is a human-readable explanation of how to answer the question, and the SPARQL query is a direct translation of that explanation into a query language. The query is designed to be executed on the ORKG RDF data dump, and the results will be specific to that data. 

    If you need to modify the query to fit your specific use case or RDF data, you may need to adjust the query accordingly. 

    The above SPARQL query is for illustrative purposes only and may need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data and the query engine being used.
