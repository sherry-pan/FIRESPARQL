Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the RotoWire (Relation Generation) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg#>
     PREFIX dcterms: <http://purl.org/dc/terms/>

     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper a orkg:ResearchPaper.
    ?paper dcterms:title?title.
    ?paper orkg:hasDataset?dataset.
    ?dataset dcterms:dataset?roterawire.
    ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:evaluation?evaluation.
     FILTER (STRLIKE(STR(?evaluation), "RotoWire") )
     }
    <|eot_id|>
