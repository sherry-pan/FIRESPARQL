Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the WMT2014 French-English dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?metric,?metric_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WMT2014 French-English")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
      ?eval           orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric;
                      rdfs:label              ?metric_lbl.
     }     ORDER BY DESC(?eval)
     LIMIT 1;     ```


SELECT DISTINCT?metric,?metric_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                 rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WMT2014 French-English")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                 orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
 ?eval           orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric;
                 rdfs:label              ?metric_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?eval)
LIMIT 1; ```


    Note: The answer is not a simple number, but rather a SPARQL query. The query is designed to find the evaluation metrics used in the WMT2014 French-English dataset. The query will return the top 1 metric, as the question asks for the most common metric. If you want to get all metrics, simply remove the LIMIT 1. 

    This query is designed to query the ORKG, getting the correct answer to the input question. The query works by first filtering the dataset to only include the WMT2014 French-English dataset. Then, it finds the benchmarking evaluations for this dataset. Finally, it extracts the evaluation metrics and their labels, ordering the results by the evaluation scores in descending order. The LIMIT 1 is used to return only the top metric. 

    The query uses the following variables:
    -?dataset: The dataset (in this case, the WMT2014 French-English dataset)
    -?benchmark: The benchmarking evaluation
    -?eval: The evaluation
    -?metric: The evaluation metric
    -?metric_lbl: The label of the evaluation metric

    The query is designed to be executed on the ORKG, and it will return the top evaluation metric used in the WMT2014 French-English dataset. 

    Note: The actual values of the variables may vary depending on the data in the ORKG. 

    The query is based on the provided context, which mentions the WMT2014 French-English dataset and the evaluation metric F1 score. The query is designed to find the top evaluation metric used in this dataset. 

    The query uses the following predicates:
    - orkgc:Dataset: The dataset
    - orkgp:HAS_DATASET: The dataset has a benchmarking evaluation
    - orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION: The benchmarking evaluation has an evaluation metric
    - orkgp:HAS_METRIC: The evaluation metric has a label
    - rdfs:label: The label of a resource

    The query is designed to be executed on the ORKG, and it will return the top evaluation metric used in the WMT2014 French-English dataset. 

    Note: The actual values of the variables may vary depending on the data in the ORKG.
