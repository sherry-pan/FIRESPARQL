Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the CUB-200-2011 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
     SELECT?titles?IDs
     WHERE {
       orkgp:R123456 orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK;
                 orkgp:INCLUDES?dataset.
       FILTER(REGEX(STR(?dataset), "CUB-200-2011"))
      ?dataset orkgp:R122689.
      ?papers orkgp:HAS_PAPER?papers.
      ?papers orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
      ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_INCLUDES?includes.
      ?includes orkgp:INCLUDES?papers.
      ?papers orkgp:HAS_ID?IDs.
      ?papers orkgp:HAS_TITLE?titles.
     }
     ``` 
    To solve this problem, we will follow the steps below:
    1.  Define the query structure.
    2.  Define the query variables.
    3.  Define the filter conditions for the query.
    4.  Define the pattern for the query.
    5.  Combine the filter conditions and pattern to form the complete query.

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Step 1: Define the Query Structure**

The query structure is a SELECT statement. The SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from the database. The general syntax for the SELECT statement is:
```sparql
SELECT?variable1?variable2...
WHERE {
 ...
}
```
In this problem, we need to retrieve the titles and IDs of the research papers that include a benchmark for the CUB-200-2011 dataset. Therefore, the query structure is as follows:

```sparql
SELECT?titles?IDs
WHERE {
 ...
}
```

**Step 2: Define the Query Variables**

In the SELECT statement, we need to define the query variables
