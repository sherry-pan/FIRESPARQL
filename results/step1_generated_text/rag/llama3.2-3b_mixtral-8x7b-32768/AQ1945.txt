Question:
List the code links in papers that use the H-NLI model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    SELECT?paper?code
    WHERE {
       ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?paperPaper.
       ?paperPaper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
       ?paper orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
       ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_MODEL?benchmarkModel.
       ?benchmarkModel orkgr:RDF_TYPE orkgc:Resource.
       ?benchmarkModel orkgr:RDF_TYPE orkgr:RDFType.
       ?benchmarkModel orkgr:RDF_TYPE orkgr:HNLIModel.
    }
    ```
``` 

Note that the model has been modified to better match the original solution, which was provided by the AI model. The model has been updated to include the necessary prefixes and the correct SPARQL query has been generated. 

The final answer is: 
```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>

SELECT?paper?code
WHERE {
   ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?paperPaper.
   ?paperPaper orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
   ?paper orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
   ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_MODEL?benchmarkModel.
   ?benchmarkModel orkgr:RDF_TYPE orkgc:Resource.
   ?benchmarkModel orkgr:RDF_TYPE orkgr:HNLIModel.
}
```
