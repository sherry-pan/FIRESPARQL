Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the STL-10 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX wdt: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/wdt#>
     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper wdt:P301?title.
    ?paper wdt:P354?id.
    ?paper wdt:P273 "STL-10".
     }<|eot_id|>
