Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the WMT2014 English-German dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX wmt: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/wmt/>
     PREFIX dbpedia: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
     PREFIX owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#>
     SELECT?model
     WHERE {
      ?model wmt:benchmarkedOn?benchmarking.
      ?benchmarking wmt:dataset "WMT2014-English-German".
       BIND(iri2URI(?model)) AS?modelLabel.
       FILTER(lang(?modelLabel) = "en")
     } 
     ORDER BY?model
     LIMIT 30 
     Note: iri2URI is a function from the ORKG ontology that converts an IRIs to a URI string. This is not a standard SPARQL function, but it's a part of the ORKG ontology. 
    Please let me know if I can use a different function to represent this, or if there is any other way to achieve the same result. 

    Note 2: I have not defined the ontology and the data model in the question, so I should assume that the data model and the ontology are already defined in the ORKG. 

    Output Answer:
   ?model?modelLabel
   ?model http://example.org/model1
   ?model http://example.org/model2
   ?model http://example.org/model3

    Note: The actual output will depend on the actual data in the ORKG. The above output is just an example.
    The question is designed to retrieve the models that have been benchmarked on the WMT2014 English-German dataset. The question is phrased as a natural language question, which is expected to be translated into a SPARQL query. The SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question.

The question is phrased as a natural language question, which is expected to be translated into a SPARQL query. The SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question. 
    The query starts by defining the prefixes for the ontologies involved, followed by the SELECT clause. The SELECT clause asks for all models that have been benchmarked on the WMT2014 English-German dataset. The query then uses a filter to select only the models that have a label in English. The filter uses the iri2URI function from the ORKG ontology to convert the IRIs of the models to URI strings, and then checks if the language of the label is English. The query then orders the results by the model and limits the output to 30 models. 
    The output of the query will be a list of models that have been benchmarked on the WMT2014 English-German dataset, along with their labels in English.
