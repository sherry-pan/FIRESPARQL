Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this question using the given context. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the Shake-Shake (SAM) model and include links to their code. 

First, I look at the context provided. It's a bunch of RDF triples from an ORKG dump. I see several resources labeled as Papers, like R6322, R6325, R6316, R6319, etc. Each of these has a label, which is the title of the paper. 

I need to extract entities and properties from the question. The main entities here are "papers" and "Shake-Shake (SAM) model". The properties would be things like "utilized" and "links to their code". 

Next, I have to find similar entities or properties in the RDF data. I'll look through the paper titles to see if any mention the Shake-Shake model or anything related. 

Looking at the titles:
- R6322: "ISOFT at QALD-4: semantic similarity-based question answering system over linked data" – doesn't mention Shake-Shake.
- R6325: "Natural language question answering over RDF" – also doesn't mention it.
- R6316: "A HMM-based approach to question answering against linked data" – HMM, not Shake-Shake.
- R6319: "QAnswer-enhanced entity matching for question answering over linked data" – mentions QAnswer, not Shake-Shake.

None of the papers in the context seem to use the Shake-Shake model. So, there are no matches. 

Therefore, the top 5 similar entities would be an empty list since none of the papers in the provided data are relevant to the Shake-Shake model.
