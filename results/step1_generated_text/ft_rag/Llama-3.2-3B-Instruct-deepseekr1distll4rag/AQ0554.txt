Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Oxford-IIIT Pets")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?paper          orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                  rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
}
```    end of code block. 

This SPARQL query retrieves the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset. The query starts by selecting all papers (denoted by the `?paper` variable) and their labels (denoted by the `?paper_lbl` variable). It then filters the results to only include papers that have a dataset with the label "Oxford-IIIT Pets". The query then retrieves the benchmarked papers (denoted by the `?cont` variable) and their labels (denoted by the `?paper_lbl` variable). Finally, it filters the results to only include papers (denoted by the `?paper` variable) that have a cont (denoted by the `?cont` variable) with a benchmark (denoted by the `?benchmark` variable). The `SELECT DISTINCT` clause ensures that each paper is only returned once. 

    Note that this query assumes that the RDF data is stored in a repository that supports the ORKG (Open Research Knowledge Graph) and that the dataset and paper labels are stored as literals. If the data is stored differently, the query may need to be modified. 

    Also note that the filter condition `str(?dataset_lbl) = "Oxford-IIIT Pets"` is used to filter the results. This is because the `==` operator does not work with strings in SPARQL. The `str` function is used to convert the string literal to a string, and the `==` operator is then used to compare the string with the literal "Oxford-IIIT Pets". 

    The query can be executed using a SPARQL query engine such as SPARQLDB, Virtuoso, or OpenLink Virtuoso. The query can also be executed using a SPARQL client such as SPARQL Query Console or SPARQL Browser. 

    The output of the query will be a list of papers that include a benchmark for the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset, along with their titles. The output will be in the format:
