Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Atari 2600 Skiing dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. 

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The main entities here are "evaluation metrics" and "Atari 2600 Skiing dataset." The property involved is "benchmarking models on," which relates models to the dataset using evaluation metrics.

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a method with steps, and R283709 and R283710 are about publications. The predicates like P39020 describe steps, and others like P27 list authors. 

I need to find entities related to evaluation metrics and the Atari dataset. However, scanning through the context, I don't see any mentions of "Atari 2600 Skiing" or specific evaluation metrics. The context talks about methods, datasets like MNIST, and metrics like F1-score or accuracy, but not the specific ones for Atari.

Since the data doesn't include the Atari dataset, I'll have to infer based on general practices. Typically, in game benchmarks, metrics like score, frames per second, or game-specific metrics are used. But without specific data, I can't point to exact URIs.

I'll structure the answer by extracting the terms and then listing possible candidates based on common knowledge, even if they're not in the provided context. I'll use the required prefixes and ensure the JSON format is correct, grouping the results under each extracted term.
