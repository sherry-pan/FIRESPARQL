Question:
List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the ImageNet 64x64 benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg#>
PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp#>

SELECT?metric?metricLabel 
WHERE {
 ?dataset orkp:EVALUATED_ON?model. 
 ?dataset orkp:HAS_DATASET?datasetLabel. 
 ?model orkp:HAS_METRIC?metric. 
 ?metric orkp:HAS_METRIC?metricLabel.
}
``` 
    Note: You should assume that the dataset label is the same as the dataset URI, and the model label is the same as the model URI. 

    Note: This query assumes that the dataset label is the same as the dataset URI, and the model label is the same as the model URI. 

    Note: The query is written in a way that it first finds the model that is evaluated on the dataset, then finds the metrics used to evaluate that model. 

    Note: The query uses the `?metric` variable to store the metric and `?metricLabel` variable to store the label of the metric.

    Note: The query uses the `?metric` variable to store the metric and `?metricLabel` variable to store the label of the metric. 

Note: The provided SPARQL query is for illustration purposes only and may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG dataset.
