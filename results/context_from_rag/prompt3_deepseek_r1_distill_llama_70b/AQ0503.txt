Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The user is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the BIOSSES dataset. 

First, I'll look through the context information to find any mentions of BIOSSES. Scanning through the data, I don't see any direct references to BIOSSES. There are mentions of other datasets like MNIST and some papers with titles and authors, but nothing about BIOSSES.

Since BIOSSES isn't in the context, I can't extract any relevant papers from the given data. The context does include information about how data is modeled using a knowledge graph and some specific papers, but none related to BIOSSES.

I should inform the user that based on the provided context, there's no information available about the BIOSSES dataset. Therefore, I can't provide a list of papers that used it for benchmarks.

Based on the provided context, there is no information available about the BIOSSES dataset or any research papers that have performed benchmarks on it. Therefore, I cannot provide a list of such papers.

{
  "question": "Give me a list of research papers alongside their titles and ids, that have performed benchmarks on the BIOSSES dataset?",
  "extracted_terms": {
    "research papers",
    "BIOSSES dataset",
    "benchmarks"
  },
  "candidates": {
    "research papers": [],
