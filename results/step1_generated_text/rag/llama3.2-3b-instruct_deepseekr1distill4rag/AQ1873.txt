Question:
Provide a list of benchmarked datasets related to the Audio Classification research area?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?uri?label?score?type?rdf_type
WHERE {
 ?uri orkgr:benchmarked_datasets?label ;
          orkgr:score?score ;
          orkgr:type?type ;
          orkgr:rdf_type?rdf_type.
 ?uri orkgr:Audio_Classification?label ;
          orkgr:score?score ;
          orkgr:type?type ;
          orkgr:rdf_type?rdf_type.
}
``` 
    Note: The SPARQL query is case-sensitive and may need to be adjusted to match the actual data schema of the ORKG. This query assumes that the RDF data is stored in a format that can be queried using the provided syntax. 

    If you'd like me to make any adjustments or modifications to the query, please let me know. 

    Additionally, if you have any questions or need further clarification on how to use the query or the provided data, feel free to ask! 

    I can also provide more context or information about the ORKG or the RDF data schema if that would be helpful. 

    Let me know if there's anything else I can help with! 

    Thanks for the opportunity to assist you! 

    Have a great day!

    ORKG Knowledge Graph Query Generator 

    ``` 

    This code is designed to generate a SPARQL query based on a natural language question and a provided RDF data dump. It uses a combination of natural language processing and knowledge graph reasoning to extract relevant terms and compute similarity scores. The generated SPARQL query is then used to query the RDF data and retrieve the top candidates for the input question. 

    Please note that this is a proof-of-concept implementation and may require adjustments to match the actual data schema of the ORKG. 

    If you'd like to modify or improve the code, please feel free to do so! 

    Thanks again for the opportunity to assist you! 

    Have a great day!
