Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Dmlab-30 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
SELECT DISTINCT ?paper ?paper_lbl
    WHERE {
      ?dataset        a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label       ?dataset_lbl.
      FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Dmlab-30")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
      ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK      ?benchmark.
      ?paper         orkgp:P31                ?cont;
                      rdfs:label               ?paper_lbl.
    }
