Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the WMT2016 English-German dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model a ora:Model.
 ?model ora:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
 ?evaluation ora:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset rdfs:label?datasetLabel.
 ?model ora:hasEvaluation?evaluationMethod.
 ?evaluationMethod a ora:EvaluationMethod.
  FILTER (bc:english(?datasetLabel) && bc:german(?datasetLabel))
}
``` 
    Note: The actual SPARQL query might need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data dump and the specific properties and classes used in the ORKG. This query is based on the provided context and the structure of the RDF data. 

    The query is designed to retrieve the models that have been evaluated on the WMT2016 English-German dataset. It does this by first selecting models that have an evaluation, and then filtering those evaluations to only include those that have a dataset with a label in both English and German. 

    Please note that the actual RDF data dump and the specific properties and classes used in the ORKG might require adjustments to this query. 

    Also, the query uses the `ora` prefix for the `Model` and `Dataset` classes, and the `ora` prefix for the `EvaluationMethod` class. The `bc` prefix is used for the `english` and `german` functions. The actual prefixes and classes used in the ORKG might be different. 

    The query also uses the `ora:hasEvaluation` and `ora:hasDataset` properties to link models to their evaluations and datasets, respectively. The actual properties used in the ORKG might be different. 

    The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include datasets with labels in both English and German. The actual filter conditions might need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data dump and the specific properties used in the ORKG. 

    Please consult the actual RDF data dump and the documentation for the ORKG to adjust this query accordingly.
