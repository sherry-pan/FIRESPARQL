Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of PARAMS metric on the FGVC Aircraft benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkpd: <http://example.org/orkpd/>

SELECT?model?metric?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model orkpd:has_metric?metric.
 ?metric orkp:has_benchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgc:has_dataset?dataset.
  FILTER (str(?metric) = "PARAMS").
  FILTER (str(?benchmark) = "FGVC Aircraft benchmark dataset").
}
```

    The goal is to generate a SPARQL query that can be executed against the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) to retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 

    Please note that the actual URIs in the SPARQL query might need to be replaced with the actual URIs present in the ORKG.
