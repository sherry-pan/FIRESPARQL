Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Dmlab-30 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
           FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Dmlab-30 dataset")
          ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
          ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
          ?paper         orkgp:HAS_CONT         ?cont.
          ?paper         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
     }   

    Note: The answer should be in the format of a SPARQL query that can be executed by the SPARQL query engine to return the desired results. The query should return the titles and IDs of the research papers that have performed benchmarks on the Dmlab-30 dataset. 

    To get the title and ID of a research paper, you should use the following predicates:
    - orkgp:HAS_TITLE
    - orkgp:HAS_ID
    - rdfs:label
    - rdfs:label

    To get the dataset and benchmark information of a research paper, you should use the following predicates:
    - orkgp:HAS_DATASET
    - orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK
    - orkgc:Dataset
    - orkgp:Predicate

    You can use the following filters to narrow down the search results:
    - FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Dmlab-30 dataset")
    - FILTER (str(?benchmark_lbl) = "performed benchmarks")
    - FILTER (str(?cont_lbl) = "Contribution 1" OR str(?cont_lbl) = "Proceedings of the 2007 conference on Digital libraries - JCDL '07")
    - FILTER (str(?paper_lbl) = "Contribution 1" OR str(?paper_lbl) = "Proceedings of the 2007 conference on Digital libraries - JCDL '07") 

    To get the correct results, you should combine these filters to get the desired output.
