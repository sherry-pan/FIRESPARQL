Question:
What is the name of the top performing model in terms of Accuracy score when benchmarked on the TriviaQA dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "TriviaQA")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                  orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
 ?eval           orkgp:HAS_VALUE        ?value;
                  orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
  BIND(xsd:float(?value) AS?val)
 ?cont         orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval;
                orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
 ?model       rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
}
ORDER BY DESC(?val)
LIMIT 5
```      ```     
    Note: The above query is based on the provided context and may need adjustments based on the actual RDF data and the requirements of the ORKG. The query aims to retrieve the top 5 models based on the Accuracy score when benchmarked on the TriviaQA dataset. However, the actual query might need to be refined based on the specific properties and relationships in the ORKG data. 

    The query works as follows:

    1. It selects all models (`?model`) and their labels (`?model_lbl`) that have been evaluated on the TriviaQA dataset.
    2. It filters the results to only include datasets labeled "TriviaQA".
    3. For each evaluation, it extracts the value (`?value`) and converts it to a float.
    4. It then orders the results by the value in descending order and limits the output to the top 5 models.
    5. The `?model_lbl` is used to get the label of the model, and the `?model` is used to get the model itself.

    Note that the actual query might need to be adjusted based on the specific properties and relationships in the ORKG data.<|eot_id|>
