Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the ObjectNet dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P31?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P32?benchmark.
      ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
       FILTER(?dataset = "ObjectNet")
      ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?eval.
      ?eval orkgp:P43131?paper.
      ?paper rdfs:label?paper_lbl.
     }<|eot_id|>
