Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question: "Which QA benchmarks incorporating more than 10000 questions?" 

First, I'll break down the question. It's asking about QA benchmarks, specifically those that have more than 10,000 questions. So, I'm looking for properties related to benchmarks, datasets, the number of questions, and possibly the size or scale of the dataset.

Looking at the JSON example provided, I see a list of properties with their labels. I'll go through each one to see which might fit.

1. **"has benchmark"**: This seems directly related because the question is about benchmarks. If a property is about whether something has a benchmark, it could indicate the presence of a benchmark dataset.

2. **"has dataset"**: Since the question is about QA benchmarks, which are datasets, this property is relevant. It indicates that the benchmark uses a specific dataset.

3. **"evaluation"**: Benchmarks are often evaluated, so this property could relate to how the benchmark is assessed, including metrics like the number of questions.

4. **"number"**: This is a bit generic, but in the context of benchmarks, it could refer to the number of questions or samples, which is exactly what the question is asking about.

5. **"dataset"**: This is another property that directly relates to datasets, which are essential for benchmarks. It could provide information about the dataset used in the benchmark.

6. **"evaluation" (again)**: It's possible that the benchmark's evaluation includes details about the dataset size, so this is another relevant property.

7. **"has dataset" (again)**: Reiterating the importance of datasets in benchmarks.

8. **"evaluation" (third time)**: Emphasizing that evaluation metrics might include the size of the dataset.

Wait, I think I might have repeated some properties. Let me make sure each is unique and relevant.

So, the properties I identified are: "has benchmark", "has dataset", "evaluation", "number", and "dataset". Each of these relates to either the benchmark itself, the dataset it uses, or the quantity of questions, which is the key part of the question.

I should also consider if there are any other properties that might be relevant, but from the list, these seem to cover the necessary aspects. Properties like "evaluation" and "number" help quantify the benchmark, while "has benchmark" and "dataset" provide the context of what's being evaluated.

I think that's a solid list. Each property addresses a part of the question, whether it's the existence of a benchmark, the dataset it uses, or the specific number of questions.
