Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the Yelp-5 benchmark dataset. The question is about listing the metrics used, so I should focus on properties related to evaluation, metrics, and performance.

First, I'll look through the JSON properties. I see "evaluation" with the label "evaluation" and IRI "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_EVALUATION". That seems directly related because evaluation metrics are what's used to assess model performance.

Next, I notice "Recall" with the label "Recall". Recall is a common metric in machine learning, so it's likely used here. Similarly, "Accuracy" is another fundamental metric, so that's a good candidate.

Then there's "macro-F1" and "micro-F1". F1 scores are important for evaluating classification tasks, especially when dealing with multiple classes, which Yelp-5 might have. Both macro and micro averaging are relevant here.

I also see "NDCG@10" which stands for Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain at position 10. This metric is often used in ranking tasks, which could be applicable if the Yelp-5 dataset involves ranking reviews or businesses.

Additionally, "has benchmark" with the label "has benchmark" seems relevant because benchmarks often include specific metrics used for evaluation. It might indicate that the dataset is part of a benchmarking framework.

I should make sure I'm not missing any other relevant metrics. Looking again, I don't see precision or other specific metrics, but the ones I've identified cover the main areas: accuracy, recall, F1 scores, and ranking metrics.

So, the properties I've selected are evaluation, Recall, Accuracy, macro-F1, micro-F1, NDCG@10, and has benchmark. Each of these plays a role in assessing model performance on the Yelp-5 dataset.

To evaluate models on the Yelp-5 benchmark dataset, the relevant properties from the JSON file are:

1. **Evaluation**: Directly related to assessing model performance.
2. **Recall**: Measures the model's ability to detect all relevant instances.
3. **Accuracy**: Indicates how often the model's predictions are correct.
4. **Macro-F1**: Assesses performance across multiple classes using macro-averaging.
5. **Micro-F1**: Provides a micro-averaged F1 score for all classes.
6. **NDCG@10**: Evaluates ranking quality at the 10th position.
7. **Has Benchmark**: Indicates the dataset is part of a benchmarking framework.

These properties collectively cover key aspects of model evaluation on the Yelp-5 dataset.
