Question:
What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset Oxford-IIIT Pets?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>

     SELECT?metric?value WHERE {
       ?benchmark?metric?value.
        FILTER (contains(str(?benchmark), "Oxford-IIIT-Pets"))
        } 
    LIMIT 1 

    Note: The metric and value should be in the same row in the dataset, so we use?benchmark?metric?value as the pattern to match the row.?benchmark is a variable to be replaced with the input question. 

    Here is the explanation for the query:
    The query first defines the prefixes for the ORKG ontology and RDF schema. Then, it defines the variables?metric and?value to store the metric and value of the top benchmark result.
    The query then filters the benchmark results to only include those related to "Oxford-IIIT-Pets". This is done by using the contains function to check if the benchmark name contains the string "Oxford-IIIT-Pets".
    Finally, the query limits the results to 1, since we are only interested in the top result. 

    The variable?benchmark is a placeholder for the input question, which needs to be replaced with the actual question. 

    Please note that the generated SPARQL query is based on the provided example and might need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG dataset. 

    I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions. 

    Here is the example of how to call the function with the input question "What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset Oxford-IIIT Pets?"
    python orkg_query_generator.py -i "What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset Oxford-IIIT Pets?" 
    The function will generate the SPARQL query and return it as a string. 
    To execute the SPARQL query, you need to provide the URI of the ORKG dataset and the SPARQL query as arguments to the orkg_query_generator.py function. 

    For example:
    python orkg_query_generator.py -i "What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset Oxford-IIIT Pets?" -d "https://example.com/orkg_dataset" -q "SELECT?metric?value WHERE {?benchmark?metric?value. FILTER (contains(str(?benchmark), \"Oxford-IIIT-Pets\")) } LIMIT 1"
    The function will generate the SPARQL query and execute it on the ORKG dataset, returning the result as a string. 

    I hope this explanation helps! Let me know if you have any further questions. 

    Please note that the function orkg_query_generator.py is not included in this code snippet, but it is assumed to be available in the same directory as this code snippet. 

    Here is the explanation of the input question: 
    The input question is "What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset Oxford-IIIT Pets?" 
    It is a natural language question that asks about the top benchmark result for the dataset "Oxford-IIIT Pets". 
    The question is phrased as a question, with the words "What is" and "result" indicating that the answer is expected to be a benchmark result. 
    The question also includes the phrase "(metric and value)", which suggests that the answer should be a specific metric and value. 
    The question includes the phrase "over the dataset Oxford-IIIT Pets", which specifies the dataset for which the benchmark result is being asked. 

    Here is the explanation of the output SPARQL query: 
    The output SPARQL query is a string that represents the SPARQL query that should be executed on the ORKG dataset to answer the input question. 
    The query uses the ORKG ontology and RDF schema prefixes to define the variables and pattern to match the benchmark results. 
    The query filters the benchmark results to only include those related to "Oxford-IIIT-Pets", and then limits the results to 1
