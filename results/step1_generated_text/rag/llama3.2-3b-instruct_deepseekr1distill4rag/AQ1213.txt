Question:
What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset BC2GM?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?metric?value 
WHERE {
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasDataset?BC2GM.
 ?BC2GM ora:hasBenchmarkResult?result.
 ?result ora:hasMetric?metric.
 ?result ora:hasValue?value.
  FILTER (str(?metric) = "validation research" AND str(?value) = "93.9" )
}
```
    Note: The `ora` prefix is used for the `ora:Dataset` and `ora:hasDataset` properties, and the `orkgp` prefix is used for the `orkgp:P97004` metric predicate. The `orkgr` prefix is used for the `orkgr:BC2GM` and `orkgr:R147244` URIs. The `orkgc` prefix is used for the `orkgc:Resource` and `orkgc:Dataset` types. The `sparql` query uses the `ora` and `orkgp` prefixes. 

    Note: The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include the top benchmark result for BC2GM, with the specified metric and value. 

    Note: The `str(?metric) = "validation research" AND str(?value) = "93.9" ` part of the `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include the top benchmark result for BC2GM, with the specified metric and value. 

    Note: The `SELECT?metric?value` part of the query is used to select the metric and value from the results. 

    Note: The `WHERE` clause is used to specify the query pattern. 

    Note: The `a ora:Dataset` part of the query is used to specify that the dataset is an instance of the `ora:Dataset` class. 

    Note: The `ora:hasDataset?BC2GM` part of the query is used to specify that the dataset has a dataset named BC2GM. 

    Note: The `ora:hasBenchmarkResult?result` part of the query is used to specify that the dataset has a benchmark result. 

    Note: The `ora:hasMetric?metric` and `ora:hasValue?value` parts of the query are used to specify that the benchmark result has a metric and a value. 

    Note: The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include the top benchmark result for BC2GM, with the specified metric and value. 

    Note: The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include the top benchmark result for BC2GM, with the specified metric and value.
