Question:
What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the WMT2014 English-German dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX wmt: <http://orkg.org/ontology/wmt/>
     SELECT?metric?value
     WHERE {
    ?benchmark?metric?value.
    ?benchmark wmt:dataset wmt:WMT2014-English-German.
    ?benchmark orkg:hasBestResult orkg:BestResult?bestResult.
    ?bestResult wmt:metric?metric.
    ?bestResult orkg:metricValue?value.
     FILTER (STR(?metric) = "ROUGE-1")
     }
     FILTER (STR(?metric) = "ROUGE-2")
     FILTER (STR(?metric) = "ROUGE-L")
     FILTER (STR(?metric) = "BLEU-1")
     FILTER (STR(?metric) = "BLEU-2")
     FILTER (STR(?metric) = "BLEU-3")
     FILTER (STR(?metric) = "BLEU-4")
     } 
    If you want to get the metric with the highest value, you can simply remove all the FILTER conditions. 
    The best result metric is usually the first one that appears in the query results. 
    Therefore, you can simply remove the last 9 FILTER conditions. 
    Note that the dataset might not be complete, so there is a chance that the query might not return any results. 
    If you want to get the top N results, you can use the LIMIT clause. 
    Note that the orkg:hasBestResult predicate is used to indicate that a benchmark has the best result.
