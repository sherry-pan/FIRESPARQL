Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the Atari 2600 Boxing dataset, including the metric and its value?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "Atari 2600 Boxing dataset" and "benchmark result." The properties involved would be something like "has benchmark" or "has result."

Looking through the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 has steps related to a method, and R147244 has a value of "93.9." There's also information about papers and their authors, like R147246 and R283710, which might not be directly relevant here.

I need to find entities similar to "Atari 2600 Boxing dataset." In the context, I see mentions of "MNIST" and "SVM," but those are datasets and models, not the Atari dataset. However, R147652 is about a method with steps, which might be related to benchmarking.

For the benchmark result, R147244 has a value of "93.9," which could be a benchmark score. The predicate P39020 describes steps, which might include how the benchmark was achieved.

I also notice that R283709 is about a journal article with keywords like "Graph analytics" and "Named entity recognition." It uses predicates like P5044 for "Journal Article" and P3000 for keywords. This might not directly relate to the Atari dataset but could be part of a method used in benchmarking.

Since the context doesn't explicitly mention the Atari 2600 Boxing dataset, I'll have to infer based on similar entities. The closest might be R147652, which is a method resource, and R147244, which has a benchmark value.

So, the extracted terms are "Atari 2600 Boxing dataset" and "benchmark result." The candidates would include R147652 as a method and R147244 for the benchmark value. The properties would be P39020 for the method steps and HAS_VALUE for the result.

I'll structure the JSON accordingly, grouping the candidates under each extracted term with their URIs and types.
