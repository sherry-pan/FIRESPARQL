Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the TempEval-3 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?metric?metric_lbl
WHERE {
  orkgp:R1 orkgp:P31 orkgp:P32
}
``` 
    Note that the query is incomplete. The question asks for "evaluation metrics", but the query only retrieves "metrics". This indicates that the query is not answering the question as it should. To answer the question, the query needs to be modified to retrieve "evaluation metrics". 

    To complete the query, you should replace "R1" with a variable, add the "evaluation metrics" pattern to the WHERE clause, and then use the variable to match the "evaluation metrics" in the SELECT clause. Here is the corrected SPARQL query:

    ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?metric?metric_lbl
WHERE {
  orkgp:R1 orkgp:P31 orkgp:P32.
  orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION_METRIC?metric.
 ?metric rdfs:label?metric_lbl.
}
```

    This corrected query retrieves the distinct "evaluation metrics" mentioned in the question.<|eot_id|>
