Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Sequential CIFAR-10 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?m?e?c WHERE {
   ?m orkg:hasModel?m2.
   ?m orkg:hasMetric?e.
   ?m orkg:hasBenchmark?c.
    FILTER (regex(str(?c), "Sequential CIFAR-10")) 
    } 

    Note: The question asked for the evaluation metrics commonly used when benchmarking models on the Sequential CIFAR-10 dataset. 
    The SPARQL query provided is one possible query that can be used to retrieve the answer to the question. The query is based on the provided context. 

    Please note that the actual answer to the question may vary based on the specific entities and properties used in the ORKG. 

    The provided SPARQL query retrieves all the metrics that are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Sequential CIFAR-10 dataset. 

    The query first filters out the models that do not have any benchmarking information. Then it filters the benchmarking information to only include the ones that contain the phrase "Sequential CIFAR-10". Finally, it retrieves the metrics that are associated with these benchmarking information. 

    The query is based on the assumption that the evaluation metrics are stored under the property orkg:hasMetric. The query also assumes that the models are stored under the property orkg:hasModel, and the benchmarking information is stored under the property orkg:hasBenchmark. 

    The query is also based on the assumption that the Sequential CIFAR-10 dataset is stored under the URI "orkgr:R122689".
