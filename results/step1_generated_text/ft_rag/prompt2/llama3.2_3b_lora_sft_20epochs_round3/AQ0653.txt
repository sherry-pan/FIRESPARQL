Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the SciCite dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P31?contrib.
      ?contrib orkgp:P34?benchmark.
      ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
       FILTER(REGEX(?dataset, "SciCite"))
      ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P15023?paper.
      ?paper orkgp:HAS_METHOD?method.
      ?method orkgp:P5041?title.
      ?title rdfs:label?paper_lbl.
     }<|eot_id|>
