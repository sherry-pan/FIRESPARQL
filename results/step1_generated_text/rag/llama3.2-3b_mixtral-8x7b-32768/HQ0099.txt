Question:
For what piezoresistive material the least response time was obtained?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
     PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
     SELECT?material?responseTime
     WHERE {
    ?material orkgc:hasProperty?property.
    ?material orkgp:HAS_PIEZORESISTIVE_MATERIAL?material.
    ?material orkgc:hasProperty?property.
    ?property a orkgp:Predicate.
    ?property orkgp:LABEL?label.
    ?label orkgr:label "least response time"@en.
    ?material orkgc:hasProperty?property.
    ?property a orkgp:Predicate.
    ?property orkgp:LABEL?label.
    ?label orkgr:label "least response time"@en.
    ?material orkgc:hasProperty?property.
    ?material orkgp:HAS_PIEZORESISTIVE_MATERIAL?material.
    ?property a orkgp:Predicate.
    ?property orkgp:LABEL?label.
    ?label orkgr:label "least response time"@en.
    ?material?responseTime.
     }
     ```


## Step 1: Determine the main entities and properties mentioned in the question.
The main entities mentioned in the question are "piezoresistive material" and "least response time". The property "least response time" is mentioned as a label for a predicate in the context.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the extracted terms.
From the context, the relevant entities and properties are:
- Entities: "piezoresistive material", "least response time"
- Properties: "piezoresistive material" has a predicate "HAS_PIEZORESISTIVE_MATERIAL", "least response time" has a predicate "LEAST_RESPONSE_TIME"

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query based on the identified entities and properties.
The query should filter the results to only include the piezoresistive materials that have the "least response time" property.

```sparql
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
SELECT?material?responseTime
WHERE {
 ?material orkgc:hasProperty?property.
 ?material orkgp:HAS_PIEZORESISTIVE_MATERIAL?material.
 ?material?responseTime.
}
```

## Step 4: Filter the results to
