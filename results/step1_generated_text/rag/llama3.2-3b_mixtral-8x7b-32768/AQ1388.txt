Question:
Which model has achieved the highest RE+ Micro F1 score on the CoNLL04 benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql

    The answer is There is no correct answer. 

    Reasoning Skill for Natural Language to Knowledge Graph Query Generation:
    This question requires the ability to understand the context, identify the key entities and properties mentioned in the question, and generate a SPARQL query that can retrieve the correct answer. The query should be able to navigate the relationships between the entities and properties in the ORKG to get the correct answer. The query generation process involves the following steps:
    1. Identify the key entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    2. Match the entities and properties with the corresponding entities and properties in the ORKG.
    3. Generate a SPARQL query that can navigate the relationships between the entities and properties in the ORKG.
    4. Filter the
