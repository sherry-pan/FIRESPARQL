Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the FSNS - Test dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>

    SELECT?metric?dataset
    WHERE {
     ?metric orkgr:hasValue?value.
     ?metric rdfs:label?metricLabel.
     ?dataset orkgc:hasDataset?datasetName.
     ?dataset rdfs:label?datasetLabel.
      FILTER (?metricLabel = "evaluation metrics" OR?datasetLabel = "fsNS - Test dataset")
      SERVICE orkgr:sparql
    }
    ``` 
    If you would like me to explain what each part of the SPARQL query does, I'd be happy to help. The query is structured to query the ORKG for resources labeled as "evaluation metrics" or "fsNS - Test dataset", and returns the corresponding metric and dataset URIs. 

    The `PREFIX` statements define the prefixes for the RDF data, which are used to construct the URIs of the resources. The `SELECT` clause specifies the variables to be returned in the result set. The `WHERE` clause contains the filter conditions, which ensure that only the resources labeled as "evaluation metrics" or "fsNS - Test dataset" are returned. The `SERVICE` clause specifies the SPARQL service to be used, which in this case is the `orkgr:sparql` service. 

    The `FILTER` clause is used to further refine the results by checking if the label of the resource matches the specified string. This ensures that only the correct resources are returned in the result set. 

    The `?metric` and `?dataset` variables are used to store the URIs of the metric and dataset resources, respectively. These variables are then returned in the result set. 

    The `?value` and `?datasetName` variables are used to store the values and names of the metric and dataset resources, respectively. These variables are not returned in the result set, but are used to provide additional information about the resources. 

    The `orkgr:hasValue` and `orkgc:hasDataset` predicates are used to query the resources that have values or datasets, respectively. The `rdfs:label` predicate is used to get the labels of the resources.
