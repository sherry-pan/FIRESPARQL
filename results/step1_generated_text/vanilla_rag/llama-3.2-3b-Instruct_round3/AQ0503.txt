Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the BIOSSES dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/>
     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
    ?dataset orkg:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:BENCHMARK?benchmark_label.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Titles?title.
    ?paper orkg:CSVW_Name?id.
     FILTER (STRLIKE(STR(?benchmark_label), "BIOSSES")).
     }<|eot_id|>
