Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the seel.cse.lsu.edu/data/refsq17.zip benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

    SELECT?model?dataset
    WHERE {
     ?model orkg:hasDataset?dataset.
      FILTER (?dataset = orkg:refsq17.zip).
      SERVICE orkg:search.
    }
    ```    Note: The `orkg:search` service is used to query the ORKG, and the `orkgc:Resource` and `orkgc:Model` types are used to represent the dataset and models respectively. The `orkgc:hasDataset` property is used to represent the relationship between a model and a dataset. The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include models that have been tested on the refsQ17.zip dataset. The `SERVICE` clause is used to specify the `orkg:search` service to use for the query. 

    Note: The actual URIs used in the SPARQL query may need to be replaced with the correct URIs from the ORKG. 

    Note: The `orkg:search` service is not a standard SPARQL service, but rather a custom service provided by the ORKG. 

    Note: The `orkgc:Resource` and `orkgc:Model` types are not standard RDF types, but rather custom types defined for the ORKG. 

    Note: The `orkgc:hasDataset` property is not a standard RDF property, but rather a custom property defined for the ORKG.

    Note: The `SERVICE` clause is not a standard SPARQL clause, but rather a custom clause used to specify the `orkg:search` service. 

    Note: The actual SPARQL query may need to be modified to fit the specific structure and vocabulary of the ORKG. 

    Note: The SPARQL query is not a standard SPARQL query, but rather a custom query designed to work with the ORKG.
