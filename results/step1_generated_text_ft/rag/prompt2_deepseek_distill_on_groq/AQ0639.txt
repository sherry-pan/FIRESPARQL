Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the Ohsumed dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "research papers" and "Ohsumed dataset". The action is "contain a benchmark over". So, I'm looking for papers that have benchmarks using the Ohsumed dataset.

Looking at the context, I see two main resources: R147246 and R284317. Both are papers with various properties. R147246 has authors like Ligia Sierra and others, published in 2015, volume 6. R284317 is from 2021, volume 11, with authors Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta, and a DOI link.

Next, I need to compute similarity. The question mentions "Ohsumed dataset", but in the context, I don't see any direct mention of it. However, R284316 talks about extracting entity knowledge and uses datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP. Since Ohsumed isn't there, maybe the closest is R284316, which discusses benchmarks and datasets.

For the candidates, I'll consider the papers as entities. R147246 and R284317 are both research papers, so they fit. I'll assign similarity scores based on how relevant their content is to benchmarks and datasets, even if Ohsumed isn't explicitly mentioned.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and the top candidates. Since there are only two papers, they'll both be in the list with their titles and IDs.
