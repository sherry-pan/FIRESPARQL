Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Atari 2600 Skiing dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>

    SELECT?evaluationMetric?benchmark?dataset
    WHERE {
       ?dataset a orkgc:Dataset.
       ?dataset orkgr:R122689 orkgp:hasDataset?hasDataset.
       ?hasDataset orkgp:hasEvaluationMetric?evaluationMetric.
       ?dataset orkgr:R122689 orkgp:hasDataset?hasDataset.
       ?hasDataset orkgp:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    }
    ```
    Note that the actual SPARQL query might need to be modified based on the actual structure of the Open Research Knowledge Graph. The provided query is based on the context and the entities/properties provided.

    What is the correct SPARQL query to generate from the input question and the provided context?
    Note that the query should be able to query the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) and get the correct answer to the input question. 

    You can ask follow-up questions like "How does the query get the answer to the input question?" or "What are the assumptions made in the query?" but the main question is what is the correct SPARQL query.
