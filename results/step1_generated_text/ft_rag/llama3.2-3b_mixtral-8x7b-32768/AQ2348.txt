Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the KD-LSTMreg model?

Generated SPARQL:

    Note: The provided SPARQL query is not a valid one because the filtering condition on the label of the model and the papers is not correct. It is assumed that the correct SPARQL query can be generated by following the context provided.
    Assumptions:
    - The papers contain the model.
    - The model is used in the papers.
    - The code is used in the papers.
    - The papers are benchmarked.
    - The benchmarking is done by the model.
    - The model is linked to the code.
    - The code is linked to the papers.
    - The papers are linked to the model.
    - The model is linked to the papers.
    - The papers are linked to the code.
    - The code is linked to the papers.
    - The papers are linked to the benchmark.
    - The benchmarking is done by the model.
    - The model is linked to the benchmark.
