To address the given question, we'll follow the steps outlined: extract entities and properties from the question, retrieve similar entities or properties from the RDF data dump based on cosine similarity, and return the top similar entities or properties. 

Given the question: "Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Penn Treebank dataset?"

1. **Extract Entities and Properties**: The key entities and properties mentioned in the question are "research paper titles," "IDs," "benchmarked models," and "Penn Treebank dataset." 

2. **Retrieve Similar Entities or Properties**: To calculate cosine similarity, we would typically vectorize the question and the labels of entities/properties from the RDF dump. However, without direct access to vectorization tools or the ability to execute code, we'll conceptually approach this by looking for entities that are related to "research papers," "benchmarking," and "Penn Treebank dataset."

From the provided RDF data dump, entities that could be related to the question based on their labels are:
- **R211524**: With a label "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire," it might not directly relate to the Penn Treebank dataset but is about a dataset and named entity recognition, which could be tangentially related.
- **R211922**: Labeled as "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)," this could be relevant as it involves modeling and named entities, potentially touching upon benchmarking aspects.
- **R212134**: Although labeled simply as "Evaluation," it could be relevant in the context of benchmarking models.
- **R36053**: With a label "Proceedings of the 2007 conference on Digital libraries - JCDL '07," it's about a venue, which might not directly answer the question but could be related to where research papers are published.
- **R36054**: Labeled as "Contribution 1," it's vague but could potentially be about contributions in the field of research papers and benchmarking.

3. **Return Top Similar Entities or Properties**: Given the constraints and the need for a conceptual approach, the top similar entities based on their potential relevance to the question could be ranked as follows. Note that without actual cosine similarity scores, this ranking is based on the conceptual relevance to the question:

    "label": "Evaluation",

  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36053",
    "label": "Proceedings of the 2007 conference on Digital libraries - JCDL '07",
    "score": 0.5
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R36054",
    "label": "Contribution 1",
    "score": 0.4
  }
]
```

This response is a conceptual approximation based on the information provided and the steps outlined for the task. Actual implementation would require computational tools for vectorization and similarity calculation.
