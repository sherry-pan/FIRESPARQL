Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the XLNet (base) model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
       orkgc:Paper?paper.
      ?paper orkgp:P31?resource.
      ?resource orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model.
      ?model orkgp:UTILIZES_MODEL?util.
      ?util orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
       FILTER(REGEX(?code, "https?://"))
       FILTER(REGEX(?code, "github\\.com"))
     } 
    Note: The code links are expected to be in the format of https or github.com. The code snippets are expected to be in the format of https://github.com/username/repository or https://github.com/username/repository/blob/branch/file.py.

    ```python
    ```
    SELECT DISTINCT?code
    WHERE {
      orkgc:Paper?paper.
     ?paper orkgp:P31?resource.
     ?resource orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model.
     ?model orkgp:UTILIZES_MODEL?util.
     ?util orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
      FILTER(REGEX(?code, "https?://"))
      FILTER(REGEX(?code, "github\\.com"))
    } 
    ```python
    }
    } 
    } 
    ```
    The final answer is:
    SELECT DISTINCT?code
    WHERE {
      orkgc:Paper?paper.
     ?paper orkgp:P31?resource.
     ?resource orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model.
     ?model orkgp:UTILIZES_MODEL?util.
     ?util orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
      FILTER(REGEX(?code, "https?://"))
      FILTER(REGEX(?code, "github\\.com"))
    } 
    ```python
    ```
    } 
    } 
    ```
    Note: The code links are expected to be in the format of https or github.com. The code snippets are expected to be in the format of https://github.com/username/repository or https://github.com/username/repository/blob/branch/file.py.

    The final answer is:
    SELECT DISTINCT?code
