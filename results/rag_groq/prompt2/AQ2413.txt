Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the CvT-21 (384 res) model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information. The context has two main sections from the ORKG RDF dump. The first part describes a research process with five steps, and the second part talks about a journal article titled "validation research" with some authors and a DOI link.

I'm looking for any mention of the CvT-21 model. Scanning through the context, I don't see any references to "CvT-21" or "model" in the first section. The second section is about a paper on entity knowledge extraction using various tools like Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight, but it doesn't mention CvT-21 either.

Since the context doesn't provide any information about the CvT-21 model or related papers, I can't extract any relevant terms or compute similarities. Therefore, the candidates list will be empty because there's no data to match the query.

I should structure the JSON response as per the example, but since there's no relevant information, the extracted terms and candidates will be empty arrays.

```json
{
  "question": "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the CvT-21 (384 res) model and include the links to their code?",
  "extracted_terms": [],
  "candidates": {}
}
```
