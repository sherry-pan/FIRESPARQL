Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the BUCC German-to-English dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://orkgr.org/resource/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://orkp.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://orkgc.org/resource/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://orkgc.org/ontology/>

SELECT?paper?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgc:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgc:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgp:includes?benchmark_for_bucc.
  FILTER (strContains(STR(?benchmark_for_bucc), 'BUCC German-to-English dataset').
 ?paper orkgp:hasContribution?contribution.
 ?contribution orkgp:hasTitle?title.
 ?contribution orkgp:hasID?id.
}
```


## Step 1: Identify the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
The entities and properties mentioned in the question are: BUCC German-to-English dataset, research papers, titles, IDs, include, and benchmark.

## Step 2: Match the entities and properties with the candidates provided in the context.
From the context, the following entities and properties can be matched:
- BUCC German-to-English dataset: orkg:R122689
- research papers: orkp:HAS_PAPER
- titles: orkgp:HAS_TITLE
- IDs: orkgp:HAS_ID
- include: orkp:INCLUDES
- benchmark: orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query using the matched entities and properties.
The SPARQL query should filter for papers that include a benchmark for the BUCC German-to-English dataset. It should also retrieve the titles and IDs of these papers.
