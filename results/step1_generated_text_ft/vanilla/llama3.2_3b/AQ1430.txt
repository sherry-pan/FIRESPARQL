Question:
Which model has achieved the highest BLEU score score on the WMT2014 English-German benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX wmt: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/metadata/wmt/>
     SELECT?model?score
     WHERE {
      ?model orkg:hasScore?score.
      ?score wmt:dataset "WMT2014 English-German".
      ?score wmt:benchmark "BLEU".
      ?score wmt:score?scoreValue.
       FILTER (?scoreValue IS NUMERIC)
       FILTER (?scoreValue > 0)
       ORDER BY DESC(?scoreValue)
       LIMIT 1
     } 
     END OF PREVIOUS RESULTS.
