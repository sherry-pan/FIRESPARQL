Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the WOS-5736 dataset, including the metric and its value?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "WOS-5736 dataset" and "benchmark result." The properties involved are "achieved on" and "metric and its value."

Looking through the context, I see that there are two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a research method with steps, and R284316 talks about a journal article on entity knowledge extraction.

I need to find mentions of the WOS-5736 dataset. Scanning the data, I don't see any direct references to "WOS-5736." However, R147244 has a value of "93.9" which might be a benchmark result. It's linked via HAS_VALUE, so maybe that's the metric.

Next, I'll look for properties related to benchmark results. R147652 has steps that mention applying NER and using a CRF algorithm, which could relate to benchmarking. R284316 discusses evaluation using different datasets and tools, which might be relevant.

Since there's no explicit mention of WOS-5736, I'll consider related datasets. R147652's steps involve datasets like MNIST, which is a benchmark dataset. R284316 uses datasets like AIDA and MEANTIME, which are also benchmarks.

I'll compute similarity scores for the extracted terms. "WOS-5736 dataset" might be similar to other benchmark datasets in the context. The metric could relate to the "93.9" value from R147244.

Putting it all together, the highest benchmark result is likely "93.9" from R147244, even though the dataset isn't explicitly named. This is an educated guess based on the available data.
