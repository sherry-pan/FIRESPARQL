Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this question using the given ORKG RDF data. The question is asking for a list of papers that have used the Funnel Transformer model and include links to their code. 

First, I should look through the provided context to see if there's any mention of the Funnel Transformer model. I'll go through each line of the context files to find relevant information.

Looking at the first file, I see entries like "BabelEnconding" and "looked at different ways to measure similarity between embeddings...". That doesn't seem related to the Funnel Transformer. There's a contribution labeled "Contribution 1" but no details about the model.

In the second file, there are resources related to Named Entity Recognition, like "Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study" and a venue "Proceedings of the 2011 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing". Again, nothing about the Funnel Transformer.

I also check for any mentions of "Funnel Transformer" or related terms like "model", "code", or "links". It seems none of the resources in the context mention the Funnel Transformer model. 

Since the context doesn't contain any information about the Funnel Transformer, I can't retrieve any relevant papers or code links from it. Therefore, the result is an empty list.

The given context does not contain any information related to the Funnel Transformer model or papers that utilized it. Therefore, no similar entities or properties can be retrieved.
