Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the AxCell model for benchmarking purposes?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The key entities and properties mentioned are "code references," "papers," "AxCell model," and "benchmarking purposes." 

Looking at the context, I see that there are papers (like R147246 and R284317) with authors, venues, and years. There are also steps described for a method involving models and datasets. However, I don't see any direct mention of "AxCell" or "code references." 

Since the data doesn't include "AxCell," I'll consider related models or datasets. The steps mention models like SVM and datasets like MNIST, which might be relevant. Also, the papers have URLs and DOIs which could be sources for code references.

I'll extract terms like "code references," "papers," "models," and "benchmarking." Then, I'll look for similar entities in the data. For "code references," maybe the URLs or DOIs in the papers are relevant. For "papers," the resources like R147246 and R284317 are candidates. For "models," SVM and other mentioned models could be similar. For "benchmarking," the evaluation steps might be relevant.

I'll compute similarity scores based on how closely these terms match the extracted terms. Since "AxCell" isn't present, I'll focus on the closest models and papers that discuss benchmarking. 

Finally, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their top candidates, ensuring the URIs and types are correctly formatted.
