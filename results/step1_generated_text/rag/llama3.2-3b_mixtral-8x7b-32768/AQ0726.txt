Question:
What are the metrics of evaluation over the seel.cse.lsu.edu/data/re17.zip  dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?p?o
WHERE {
 ?s a orkg:Dataset.
 ?s orkg:hasMetric?p.
 ?p orkg:hasEvaluation?o.
  FILTER (URI(?s) = "orkgr:R122689" AND URI(?o) = "orkgp:HAS_METRIC")
}
``` sparql
Note: The provided SPARQL query assumes that the ORKG is already queried and the data is available. Also, please note that the provided context is just a sample and might need to be adjusted based on the actual data in the ORKG. 

## Step 1: Understand the context provided
The context includes the extracted terms from the input question, which are "seel.cse.lsu.edu/data/re17.zip" and "metrics of evaluation". It also includes candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to these terms. Specifically, the candidate entities are a resource with URI "orkgr:R122689" and two predicates "orkgp:HAS_METRIC" and "orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION".

## Step 2: Determine the query pattern
Based on the context, the query pattern can be determined as follows: Find the dataset with URI "orkgr:R122689", and then find the metrics of evaluation for this dataset. The metrics of evaluation are represented by the predicate "orkgp:HAS_METRIC".

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query
The SPARQL query can be constructed using the following pattern:
```sparql
SELECT?p?o
WHERE {
 ?s a orkg:Dataset.
 ?s orkg:hasMetric?p.
 ?p orkg:hasEvaluation?o.
  FILTER (URI(?s) = "orkgr:R122689" AND URI(?o) = "orkgp:HAS_METRIC")
}
```
This query selects the predicate and object of the "hasMetric" triple that has the evaluation metric represented by "orkgp:HAS_METRIC".

## Step 4: Execute the SPARQL query
The SPARQL query can be executed on the ORKG to retrieve the metrics of evaluation for the specified dataset.

The final answer is: ```sparql
SELECT?p?o
WHERE {
 ?s a orkg:Dataset.
 ?s orkg:hasMetric?p.
 ?p orkg:hasEvaluation?o.
  FILTER (URI(?s) = "orkgr:R122689" AND URI(?o) = "orkgp:HAS_METRIC")
}
``` sparql
Note: The provided SPARQL query assumes that the ORKG is already queried and the data is available. Also, please note that the provided context is just a sample and might need to be adjusted based on the actual data in the ORKG. 

Therefore, the final answer is the SPARQL query itself. 

The final answer is
