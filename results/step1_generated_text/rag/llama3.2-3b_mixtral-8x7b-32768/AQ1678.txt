Note that the SPARQL query generated above is not the optimal solution and may require adjustments to work correctly with the actual data in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). The query is generated based on the provided context and may not be the most efficient or effective query to retrieve the correct answer. 

The optimal solution would require a more in-depth analysis of the data and the relationships between the entities and properties in the ORKG. 

However, the generated SPARQL query can be used as a starting point for further refinement and optimization. 

It's also worth noting that the actual SPARQL query may require additional prefixes or namespace declarations to work correctly with the ORKG data.
