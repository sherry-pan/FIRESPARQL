Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
    ?code rdfs:label?label
     WHERE {
         orkgp:Paper orkgp:HAS_DATASET orkgp:DATASET?dataset.
        ?dataset orkgp:P31?paper.
        ?paper orkgp:P31?cont.
        ?cont orkgp:HAS_SOURCE?source.
        ?source orkgp:P31?code.
        ?code rdfs:label?label.
         FILTER(REGEX(?label, "BiDAF|Self|Attention|ELMo"))
     } GROUP BY?code
     ORDER BY (COUNT(?code) DESC)
     LIMIT 5
```
    This query finds the code references (represented by the `code` resource) in the papers that have used the BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo model for benchmarking purposes. The query uses the `REGEX` filter to search for the specific model labels in the code references. The results are grouped by code and ordered by the count of papers that use each code. The top 5 codes are returned. 

    The query uses the following predicates:
    * `orkgp:Paper`: represents a paper.
    * `orkgp:HAS_DATASET`: represents a dataset that the paper is part of.
    * `orkgp:DATASET`: represents a dataset.
    * `orkgp:P31`: represents a resource that is a subclass of `orkgp:Paper`.
    * `orkgp:HAS_SOURCE`: represents a code reference that the paper is part of.
    * `orkgp:P31`: represents a resource that is a subclass of `orkgp:HAS_SOURCE`.
    * `rdfs:label`: represents the label of a resource.
    * `REGEX`: a filter that matches a regular expression. 

    The query uses the `FILTER` clause to filter the results to only include code references that contain the BiDAF, Self Attention, or ELMo labels. The `GROUP BY` clause groups the results by code, and the `ORDER BY` clause orders the results by the count of papers that use each code. The `LIMIT` clause limits the results to the top 5 codes. 

    The query assumes that the `orkgp` namespace is defined in the RDF data, and that the `REGEX` filter is enabled. 

    Please note that this query is a direct translation of the provided JSON response into a SPARQL query. It may not be the most efficient or optimal query for the task, but it should work correctly. 

    The output of this query is expected to be a list of code references that have been used in papers that have used the BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo model for benchmarking purposes. Each code reference will be represented by a tuple containing the code reference itself and its label. 

    The code references are expected to be represented by resources that have a `rdfs:label` property, and the labels are expected to be strings. 

    The query uses the `REGEX` filter to search for the specific model labels in the code references. The regular expression pattern used is `BiDAF|Self|Attention|ELMo`, which matches any of the four model names. 

    The query also uses the `FILTER` clause to filter the results to only include code references that have a label that starts with the model name. 

    The query is designed to work with the ORKG RDF data dump, and it assumes that the `orkgp` namespace is defined in the RDF data. 

    The query uses the following variables:
    * `?code`: represents the code reference.
    * `?label`: represents the label of the code reference. 

    The query uses the following predicates:
    * `orkgp:Paper`: represents a paper.
    * `orkgp:HAS_DATASET`: represents a dataset that the paper is part of.
    * `orkgp:DATASET`: represents a dataset.
    * `orkgp:P31`: represents a resource that is a subclass of `orkgp:Paper`.
    * `orkgp:HAS_SOURCE`: represents a code reference that the paper is part of.
    * `orkgp:P31`: represents a resource that is a subclass of `orkgp:HAS_SOURCE`.
    * `rdfs:label`: represents the label of a resource.
    * `REGEX`: a filter that matches a regular expression.
