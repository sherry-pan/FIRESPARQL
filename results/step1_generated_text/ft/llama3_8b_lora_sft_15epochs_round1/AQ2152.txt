Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Past Decode Reg. + AWD-LSTM-MoS + dyn. eval. model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
      WHERE {
      ?papers rdfs:label?title.
       FILTER (str(?title) = "papers that have used the Past Decode Reg. + AWD-LSTM-MoS + dyn. eval. model for benchmarking purposes.")
      ?papers orkgp:P31?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P30?model.
      ?model orkgp:P5008?code.
      }<|eot_id|>
