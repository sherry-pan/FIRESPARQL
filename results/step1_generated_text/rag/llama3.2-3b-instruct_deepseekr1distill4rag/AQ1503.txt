Question:
What is the best performing model benchmarking the Supervised: dataset in terms of SemEval 2013 metric?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset?metric
WHERE {
 ?model rdfs:label?model_label.
 ?model rdfs:label?model_label2.
 ?dataset rdfs:label?dataset_label.
 ?metric rdfs:label?metric_label.
 ?model wkm:isBenchmarkFor?dataset.
 ?dataset rdfs:label "Supervised:".
 ?metric rdfs:label "SemEval 2013".
  BIND(STR(?model_label) + " " + STR(?dataset_label) + " " + STR(?metric_label) + " ") AS?answer
}
```
    Note: The SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context and the explanation of the process. The query is designed to retrieve the best performing model for the Supervised: dataset in terms of the SemEval 2013 metric. The query uses the RDF prefixes and types defined in the context to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG. 

    The query first retrieves the labels of the model, dataset, and metric using the rdfs:label predicate. It then uses the wkm:isBenchmarkFor predicate to link the model to the dataset. The dataset is filtered to only include those with the label "Supervised:". The metric is filtered to only include those with the label "SemEval 2013". Finally, the query binds the labels of the model, dataset, and metric together with a space separator to form the answer.
