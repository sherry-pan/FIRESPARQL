Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What is the name of the top performing model in terms of F1 score when benchmarked on the Natural Questions (long) dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "model" and "Natural Questions (long) dataset". The property mentioned is "F1 score" and the action is "benchmark on".

Looking through the context, I see that there are two main resources, R147652 and R284316, which describe steps and a research paper respectively. R147652 talks about a method involving SVM and MNIST, which might be a model and dataset. R284316 discusses a journal article about extracting entity knowledge using techniques like jpark, which might be a model.

I'll compute the similarity between the extracted terms and the entities in the context. "Natural Questions (long) dataset" isn't explicitly mentioned, but R147652 uses MNIST, which is a known dataset. The models mentioned are SVM and jpark. Since the question is about F1 score, I'll look for entities related to performance metrics.

From R147652, the steps involve SVM and MNIST, so SVM is a model. R284316's paper uses jpark, which is another model. The F1 score isn't directly mentioned, but R147244 has a value of 93.9, which could be a performance metric.

I'll select the top candidates based on similarity. SVM and jpark are the models, and MNIST is the closest dataset. The F1 score relates to the 93.9 value from R147244.

So, the top candidates would be SVM and jpark as models, MNIST as the dataset, and the F1 score from R147244.
