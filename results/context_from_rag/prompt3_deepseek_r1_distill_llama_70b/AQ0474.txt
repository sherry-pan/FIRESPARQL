Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The user is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the RotoWire dataset. 

First, I'll look through the context information. I see that there are two main resources mentioned: R147246 and R283710. Each has properties like authors, venue, year, etc. 

I need to extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "research papers" and "RotoWire dataset". The property is "performed benchmarks on". 

Looking at the context, I don't see any mention of the RotoWire dataset. So, I can't find any direct matches. However, I can look for papers that are related to benchmarks or datasets in general. 

R147246 is associated with authors like Ligia Sierra and others, published in 2015. R283710 is from 2021 with authors Yuanyuan Wu and others. Both papers deal with topics like keyphrase extraction, named entity recognition, and graph analytics, which might involve benchmarking datasets. 

Since there's no direct link to RotoWire, I'll consider these papers as potential candidates because they discuss benchmark datasets and methods. 

I'll structure the answer to include these papers, noting that while they don't specifically mention RotoWire, they are relevant to benchmarking datasets in NLP tasks.
