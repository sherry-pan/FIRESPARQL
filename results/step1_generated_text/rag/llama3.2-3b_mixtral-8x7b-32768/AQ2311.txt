Question:
List the code links in papers that use the POP3D model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    SELECT?paper?codeLink
    WHERE {
     ?paper a http://orkg.org/orkg/class/Contribution.
     ?paper rdfs:label?label.
     ?paper rdfs:label?label.
     ?paper rdfs:label?label.
     ?paper rdfs:label?label.
     ?paper rdfs:label?label.
     ?paper rdfs:label?label.
     ?paper?use?label.
     ?use a http://orkg.org/orkg/class/Resource.
     ?paper?codeLink?label.
      FILTER (regex(str(?label), "POP3D") && regex(str(?label), "benchmark"))
    }
    ``` 
    Note that the original query is in the context of a question answering task, where the goal is to retrieve code links for papers that use the POP3D model in any benchmark. The original query uses the `regex` function to filter the results based on the presence of the POP3D model and any benchmark in the label of the paper. However, the provided query does not use the `regex` function correctly. The corrected query is shown below.
    ```sparql
    SELECT?paper?codeLink
    WHERE {
     ?paper a http://orkg.org/orkg/class/Contribution.
     ?paper?use?label.
     ?use a http://orkg.org/orkg/class/Resource.
     ?label rdfs:label?label.
     ?paper?codeLink?label.
      FILTER (regex(str(?label), "POP3D") && regex(str(?label), "benchmark"))
    }
    ``` 
    Note that the corrected query filters the results based on the presence of the POP3D model and any benchmark in the label of the paper's use statement. This query retrieves the correct code links for papers that use the POP3D model in any benchmark. 

    The correct SPARQL query is:
    ```sparql
    SELECT?paper?codeLink
    WHERE {
