Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of models tested on the QNLI benchmark dataset. 

First, I'll look through the context information. I see that there are several resources and predicates related to models, datasets, and evaluations. For example, R147652 describes a method involving SVM and MNIST, which are a model and a dataset. There's also information about CRF algorithms and named entity recognition approaches.

I notice that the context includes entities like "SVM" and "MNIST" as seed terms. Since the question is about models tested on QNLI, I should look for similar models and datasets. However, QNLI isn't explicitly mentioned, so I'll have to infer based on related terms.

The context mentions steps involving NER approaches and CRF algorithms, which are models. So, I can consider these as potential candidates. Also, the analysis involves keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition, which are tasks where models like SVM and CRF are applied.

I'll extract terms like "models," "tested on," and "QNLI benchmark dataset." Then, I'll find similar entities in the context. Since QNLI isn't present, I'll look for other benchmark datasets like MNIST and see if any models are associated with them.

Looking at the resources, R147652 is associated with methods and datasets. The models mentioned include SVM and CRF. I'll list these as candidates. Also, the predicates like P39020 describe steps, which might relate to testing models on datasets.

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their candidates, using the appropriate RDF prefixes. Each candidate will have a URI, label, and type. Since QNLI isn't in the context, I'll focus on the available models and datasets, linking them where possible.

Finally, I'll ensure the JSON follows the specified format, grouping results by extracted terms and including the necessary details for each candidate.
