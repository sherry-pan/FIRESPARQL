Question:
Can you provide the highest benchmark result, including the metric and score, for the Sequential MNIST dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
SELECT?metric?score WHERE {
 ?dataset orkgc:hasDataset orkgr:R122689.
 ?dataset orkgr:hasMetric?metric.
 ?dataset orkgr:hasScore?score.
  FILTER (?metric = orkgp:BestResultMetric  )
  FILTER (?score = orkgp:BestResultScore  )
}
     Note: The actual metric and score might be different. The above query is generated based on the given context and question. The actual query might need to be adjusted to match the actual metric and score. 

    This problem requires you to generate the SPARQL query based on the provided context and question. You can use the provided context to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG, and generate the SPARQL query accordingly.

    The SPARQL query should be able to query the ORKG and retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 

    The context provides the following information:
    1. Terms (entities and properties) mentioned in the question.
    2. Candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.

    The provided context includes the following information:
    1. Terms (entities and properties) mentioned in the question.
    2. Candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.

    The provided context includes the following entities and properties:
    1. "highest benchmark result",
    2. "Sequential MNIST dataset",
    3. "metric",
    4. "score".
    5. Candidate entities and properties:
    1. "Has Best Result",
    2. "MNIST",
    3. "Has Dataset",
    4. "Has Metric",
    5. "Has Score".

    Based on the provided context, the generated SPARQL query should be able to query the ORKG and retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 

    The generated SPARQL query is:
    PREFIX orkgr: <http
