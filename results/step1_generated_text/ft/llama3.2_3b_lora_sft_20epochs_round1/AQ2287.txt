Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Pointer + Coverage + EntailmentGen + QuestionGen model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper a orkgc:Paper;
         rdfs:label?title.
       FILTER(REGEX(?title, "Pointer + Coverage + EntailmentGen + QuestionGen")
              &&?title, "benchmarking")
      ?paper orkgp:P31?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P330?code.
     }<|eot_id|>
