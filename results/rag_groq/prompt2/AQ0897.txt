Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Oxford-IIIT Pets benchmark dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "metrics" and "Oxford-IIIT Pets benchmark dataset". The property is "evaluate models on".

Looking through the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a method with several steps, and R284316 talks about a research article on entity knowledge extraction. However, I don't see any direct mention of "metrics" or "Oxford-IIIT Pets" in the provided data.

Since the data doesn't include the specific dataset or metrics mentioned, I can't find any matching entities or properties. Therefore, the candidates for both extracted terms will be empty.
