Alright, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the Atari 2600 Fishing Derby benchmark dataset. The question is about listing the metrics used, so I should focus on properties related to evaluation, benchmarks, and metrics.

First, I'll look through the JSON properties. The ones that stand out are those with labels like "evaluation", "benchmark", "metric", etc. 

I see a property with label "evaluation" (P71075). That seems directly relevant because it's about assessing model performance.

Next, "has benchmark" (P71068) is another good fit since benchmarks are used to evaluate models on specific datasets.

There's also "method" (P97142) which might refer to the evaluation methods used, so that's relevant too.

I should make sure each selected property clearly relates to evaluation metrics or benchmarking. These three properties seem to cover the necessary aspects for answering the question about metrics used on the Atari dataset.
