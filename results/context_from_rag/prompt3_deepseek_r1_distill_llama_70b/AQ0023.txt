Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of models tested on the SciCite benchmark dataset. 

First, I'll look through the context information. I see that there are several RDF triples. The first part talks about a resource R147652 which has steps involving methods and datasets. It mentions using SciBERT for expansion and a CRF algorithm for NER. 

Then, there's another resource R283709 which is a journal article about methods like keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition. It mentions using Graph analytics, Horizon 2020, Keyphrase extraction, Knowledge graph, Named entity recognition, etc. The authors include Yuanyuan Wu, Mengxing Huang, Zhaocheng Tu, and Siling Feng.

Looking for mentions of models, I see that in R147652, they use SVM and MNIST as seed terms. They also use SciBERT and CRF algorithms. In R283709, the methods include keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition, which are tasks where models like SVM, CRF, and SciBERT are applied.

The question is about models tested on SciCite. Since SciCite isn't directly mentioned, but SciBERT is, which is a model. So, I can infer that models like SVM, CRF, and SciBERT are relevant. 

I'll extract the terms: SciCite benchmark dataset, models, tested on. Then, find similar entities. From the context, the models mentioned are SVM, SciBERT, and CRF. 

So, the candidates for models would include these. Since the exact dataset isn't in the context, I'll focus on the models used in the steps, which are SVM, SciBERT, and CRF. 

I'll structure the JSON accordingly, grouping the extracted terms and listing the models with their URIs and types.
