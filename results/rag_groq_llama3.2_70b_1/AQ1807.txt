To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined:

1. **Extract entities and properties from the question**: The question mentions "model", "Accuracy metric", "Kuzushiji-MNIST benchmark dataset". These are the key terms we will focus on.

2. **Retrieve similar entities or properties from the RDF data dump**: We will calculate the cosine similarity between the question and the labels of entities/properties in the RDF data. Since the actual implementation of cosine similarity calculation and RDF parsing is complex and typically involves programming, we'll simulate this step based on the provided context.

Given the context, entities like "BioBERT" (which achieved the highest F1 scores, implying it might perform well in other metrics like accuracy), "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire", and "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)" could be relevant. However, without direct mentions of "Kuzushiji-MNIST" or "Accuracy metric" in the labels, we must infer based on the information provided.

3. **Return the top similar entities or properties**: Since the actual calculation of cosine similarity requires specific tools or programming, we'll conceptually select entities that might be relevant based on their labels and the context provided.

Given the information and the need to simulate an answer without actual computation, here's a conceptual response based on the steps outlined:

```json
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R44252",
    "label": "BioBERT achieved the highest F1 scores",
    "score": 0.8
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524",
    "label": "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire",
    "score": 0.7
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211922",
    "label": "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)",
    "score": 0.6
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211327",
    "label": "Paper",
    "score": 0.5
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R212134",
    "label": "Evaluation",
    "score": 0.4
  }
]
```

**Note**: The scores are hypothetical and used for demonstration purposes. Actual scores would depend on the cosine similarity calculation between the question and the entity/property labels in the RDF data dump. This response assumes that entities related to performance metrics (like BioBERT) and those related to neural modeling or evaluations might have higher similarity scores due to their relevance to the question's context.
