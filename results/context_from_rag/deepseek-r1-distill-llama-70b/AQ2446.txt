Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question about papers using the Shake-Shake (SAM) model and their code links. Let me break this down.

First, the question is asking for a list of papers. So, I should look for properties related to papers or publications. In the JSON, I see properties like "has benchmark" and "evaluation" which might be related to how models are tested, but not directly about the papers themselves.

Next, the question mentions the Shake-Shake (SAM) model. I need properties that can link to specific models or methods. The property "method" with label "method" seems relevant because it can refer to the model used in the papers.

The question also asks for code links. So, I should look for properties related to implementations or code. The property "implementation" with label "implementation" fits here because it likely points to where the code is hosted or described.

Additionally, the question is about papers that utilized the model, so properties that indicate usage or application are important. "Has dataset" might be useful if the papers used specific datasets with the model, but it's not directly about the code.

Putting it all together, the most relevant properties are "method" for the model, "implementation" for the code, and "has dataset" for any associated datasets. These should help in identifying the relevant papers and their code links.
