Question:
What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset RotoWire (Relation Generation)?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?metric?metric_lbl (MAX(?value) AS?score)
    WHERE {
     ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
      FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "RotoWire (Relation Generation)")
     ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
     ?eval           orkgp:HAS_VALUE        ?value.
      OPTIONAL {?eval           orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.
              ?metric          rdfs:label              ?metric_lbl.}
     ?cont         orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      OPTIONAL {?cont      orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
               ?model      rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.}
    } ORDER BY DESC(?score) LIMIT 1;     ``` select distinct?metric?metric_lbl (max(?value) as?score)
    where {
     ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
      filter (str(?dataset_lbl) = "RotoWire (Relation Generation)")
     ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
     ?eval           orkgp:HAS_VALUE        ?value.
      optional {?eval           orkgp:HAS_METRIC        ?metric.
               ?metric          rdfs:label              ?metric_lbl.}
     ?cont         orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      optional {?cont      orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
               ?model      rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.}
    } order by desc(?score) limit 1; ``` 
    Note that the answer is the top benchmark result, which is the highest score, and is therefore sorted in descending order. The LIMIT 1 clause is used to get only the first (and only) result. 

    If you want to get the top k results, you can replace the LIMIT 1 with LIMIT?k. 

    If you want to get the average score, you can use the AVG function instead of MAX, like this: 
    SELECT DISTINCT?metric?metric_lbl AVG(?value) AS?score
   ... (rest of the query remains the same) 

    If you want to get the median score, you can use the PERCENTILE_CONT function instead of MAX, like this: 
    SELECT DISTINCT?metric?metric_lbl PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY?value) AS?score
   ... (rest of the query remains the same) 

    Please note that the PERCENTILE_CONT function is only available in SPARQL 1.1. 
    If you are using an older version of SPARQL, you may need to use a different approach, such as using the AVG and COUNT functions to calculate the median. 

    Also, note that the PERCENTILE_CONT function is only available in the SELECT clause, and not in the WHERE clause. 

    If you want to get the standard deviation of the scores, you can use the STDEV function, like this: 
    SELECT DISTINCT?metric?metric_lbl STDEV(?value) AS?score
   ... (rest of the query remains the same) 

    If you want to get the variance of the scores, you can use the VAR function, like this: 
    SELECT DISTINCT?metric?metric_lbl VAR(?value) AS?score
   ... (rest of the query remains the same) 

    Please note that the STDEV and VAR functions are only available in SPARQL 1.1. 

    If you are using an older version of SPARQL, you may need to use a different approach, such as using the AVG and COUNT functions to calculate the variance. 

    Also, note that the STDEV and VAR functions are only available in the SELECT clause, and not in the WHERE clause. 

    Finally, note that the above queries assume that the?value is of type xsd:float. If it's not, you may need to use a different data type, such as xsd:decimal or xsd:int. 

    You can also use the GROUP BY clause to group the results by a specific metric
