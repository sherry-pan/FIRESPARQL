Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the query: "List the code links in papers that use the DDQN-PC model in any benchmark?" using the provided ORKG RDF data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "DDQN-PC model" and "code links in papers." The action is "use" and the context is "any benchmark. So, I'm looking for papers that use the DDQN-PC model and have code links associated with them.

Next, I need to find similar entities or properties in the RDF data. Looking through the context, I see several resources and predicates. For example, R147246 is a paper with authors and a venue. R283710 is another paper with its own details. The predicates like P27 mention authors, P28 is the year, P29 is the venue, etc.

I'm specifically interested in any mentions of models and code links. The term "DDQN-PC" isn't directly mentioned, but I can look for related models or any code-related properties. In the context, I see P39020 which describes steps, but not directly code links. However, P27 lists authors, which might be a clue if any of them are associated with code.

Since the exact model isn't present, I'll consider related models. For example, R147244 has a value of 93.9, which might be an accuracy score, but not a model name. R283709 talks about entity extraction and graph analytics, which is a bit different.

I'll also look for any properties that indicate code or links. The context doesn't have a direct "code link" predicate, but perhaps P31 (isDefinedBy) or P97003 (entity extraction could relate to code). Alternatively, maybe P41924 (scholarly domain) or P5044 (Journal Article) could be relevant if the paper includes a link.

Now, I'll try to match these. Since "DDQN-PC" isn't found, I'll look for any model-related resources. R147244 and R147246 are papers, but they don't mention models. R283709 and R283710 are about methods and solutions, not specific models.

For code links, I might need to infer from the context. If a paper is listed, perhaps it has a link, but the context doesn't provide explicit code links. So, I might have to assume that the papers themselves are the links, even without explicit code URLs.

Putting it together, I'll structure the JSON with the extracted terms and the closest matches. Since "DDQN-PC" isn't present, I'll include the papers as potential candidates, assuming they might have code links elsewhere.
