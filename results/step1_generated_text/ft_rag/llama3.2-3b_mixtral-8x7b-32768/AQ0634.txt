Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the Amazon-2 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
    WHERE {
      orkgp:R123456?HAS_DATASET.
      orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset?HAS_DATASET.
     ?dataset orkgp:P31?cont.
     ?cont orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
     ?benchmark orkgp:RDFS_LABEL?benchmark_lbl.
     ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
     ?dataset orkgp:HAS_PAPER?paper.
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_ID?paper_lbl.
    }
    ```

- titles (property)
- IDs (property)
- has dataset (property)
- has paper (property)
- has benchmark (property)
- has ID (property)
- has title (property)
- includes (property)
- has dataset (property)
- Paper (resource)
- orkgp:HAS_DATASET (predicate)
- orkgp:HAS_PAPER (predicate)
- orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK (predicate)
- orkgp:HAS_ID (predicate)
- orkgp:HAS_TITLE (predicate)
- orkgp:HAS_DATASET (predicate)
- orkgp:P31 (predicate)
- orkgp:HAS_DATASET (property)
