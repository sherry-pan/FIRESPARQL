Question:
Can you provide the highest benchmark result, including the metric and score, for the Natural Questions (long) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>

    SELECT?metric?score
    WHERE {
   ?dataset orkgc:hasDataset orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset1.
    filter(URI(?dataset1) = <http://example.org/orkgr/R122689>).
   ?dataset1 orkgc:hasResource?resource.
    filter(URI(?resource) = <http://example.org/orkgc/R122689>).
   ?resource orkgp:hasBestResult?result.
    filter(URI(?result) = <http://example.org/orkgp/123456>).
   ?result orkgp:hasMetric?metric.
   ?metric orkgp:hasScore?score.
    }
    ``` 
    Given the input question and context, the SPARQL query is generated to retrieve the highest benchmark result, including the metric and score, for the Natural Questions (long) dataset. The query first identifies the dataset, then finds the resource that has the dataset, and then finds the best result that has the dataset, metric, and score. The query uses the provided prefixes to link the entities and properties in the ORKG. 

    Note that the actual URI values in the query are fictional and may need to be replaced with the actual URIs in the ORKG. 

    This query assumes that the dataset is a resource that has a single resource, and the best result is a predicate that has a single metric and score. If this is not the case, the query may need to be modified accordingly. 

    The query also assumes that the dataset and resource have unique URIs. If this is not the case, the query may need to be modified to handle duplicates. 

    Finally, the query uses a filter to restrict the results to the specific dataset and resource. This is necessary because the query may retrieve results for other datasets or resources that match the predicates, but not the specific one being queried. 

    To get the actual results, the query would need to be executed against the ORKG, and the results would need to be processed and analyzed accordingly. 

    The provided SPARQL query is a solution to the problem, but it may need to be modified to fit the specific requirements of the ORKG and the input question
