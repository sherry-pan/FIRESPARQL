Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user is asking for a list of papers that used the DY-MobileNetV3-Small model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of the model. Scanning through the triples, I see that the context includes information about various resources, such as R147652, which describes a method involving steps using SVM and MNIST. There's also R147244 with a value of 93.9, but that doesn't seem relevant. 

Looking further, I find R283709, which is a journal article with keywords like "Graph analytics" and "Named entity recognition." The authors include Yuanyuan Wu, Mengxing Huang, Zhaocheng Tu, and Siling Feng. However, there's no mention of DY-MobileNetV3-Small here either.

Since the context doesn't have any direct references to DY-MobileNetV3-Small, I can't extract specific papers or code links. The example provided in the query uses MPQA benchmark and models, but in this case, the model in question isn't present in the data.

I should structure the answer according to the expected JSON format. I'll extract the terms "DY-MobileNetV3-Small model," "papers," and "links to their code." For each term, I'll list the candidates. Since the model isn't found, the candidates will be empty. Similarly, papers and code links won't have matches.

I need to ensure the JSON uses the correct prefixes and includes the necessary fields like uri, rdfs:label, and rdf:type, even if they're empty in this case. 

So, the final JSON will reflect that no relevant candidates were found based on the provided context.

  "question": "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the DY-MobileNetV3-Small model and include the links to their code?",
  "extracted_terms": {
    "DY-MobileNetV3-Small model": {},

    "links to their code": {}
  },
  "candidates": {

    "papers": [],
    "links to their code": []
  }
}
