Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the MPQA dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper a orkg:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper orkg:has_benchmarked_model?model.
 ?model orkg:has_benchmarked_on?dataset.
 ?dataset a orkg:Dataset.
 ?dataset orkg:label "MPQA dataset".
}
```    Note: The actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG RDF data dump. This query is just an example based on the provided context.<|eot_id|>
