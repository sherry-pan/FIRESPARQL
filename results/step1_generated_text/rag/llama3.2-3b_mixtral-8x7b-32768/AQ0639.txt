Question:
List the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the Ohsumed dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql

     PREFIX orkp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/orkp/>

     PREFIX orkgr: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/orkgr/>

     SELECT?paper?title?id
     WHERE {
      ?paper a orkgc:Contribution.
       ORKGP:CONTAINS?paper?benchmark.
      ?benchmark rdfs:label?benchmarkLabel.
      ?benchmark orkp:hasDataset?benchmarkDataset.
       FILTER (STR(?benchmarkLabel) = "benchmark over the Ohsumed dataset").

    Note that the generated SPARQL query is not necessarily the optimal or the most efficient query. The goal is to demonstrate how to generate the correct query based on the provided context and question. 

    The query starts by selecting the?paper,?title, and?id variables. Then, it filters the papers based on the existence of a benchmark and the specific label of the benchmark. The query then filters the benchmarks based on the presence of the Ohsumed dataset and the correct label. The final step filters the papers based on the presence of the correct benchmark paper and retrieves the title and ID of that paper. 

    Please note that the actual query might need to be optimized based on the actual data and the specific requirements of the application. 

    You can also run the query using a SPARQL query engine like SPARQLQuery or SPARQL Query Console to get the
