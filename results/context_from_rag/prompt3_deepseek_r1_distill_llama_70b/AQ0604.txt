Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the Atari 2600 Venture dataset. They want the papers along with their titles and IDs.

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of research papers or benchmarks related to the Atari 2600 dataset. The context includes several RDF triples from ORKG. 

Looking at the first file, I see entries for R147652, which describes a method involving steps like seed terms, expansion, annotation, NER, and filtering. There's also R147244 with a value of 93.9, which might be an accuracy score. Then there are some papers listed, like R147246, which has authors Ligia Sierra, Betty L LÃ³pez, Flavio Forni, Maria Angela Vandelli, Michele Zoli, and Antonietta Vilella, published in 2015, volume 6. 

In the second file, there's R283709, which is a journal article with keywords like Graph analytics, Horizon 2020, Keyphrase extraction, etc. It's published in 2021, volume 8, with authors Yuanyuan Wu, Mengxing Huang, Zhaocheng Tu, and Siling Feng.

I don't see any direct mention of the Atari 2600 dataset in the context. The datasets mentioned are MNIST and MPQA benchmark. Since the user is asking about Atari 2600, which isn't present, I can't find any relevant papers from the context.

Therefore, the answer should indicate that there are no matching papers in the provided data. The JSON structure should reflect this, with empty arrays for each extracted term.
