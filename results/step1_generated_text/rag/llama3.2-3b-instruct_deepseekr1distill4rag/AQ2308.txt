Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the A3C FF hs model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc#>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr#>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp#>
PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>

SELECT?paper?paperCode?model 
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgr:code?paperCode.
 ?paper orkgr:usesModel?model.
  FILTER (str(?model) = "A3C FF hs").
}
``` 
    Note: You can assume that the RDF prefixes are defined elsewhere in the context or the knowledge graph, and the SPARQL query is executed on the ORKG. 

    The SPARQL query provided above will return any papers that use the A3C FF hs model, along with their code links. However, since there's no information about the A3C FF hs model in the provided context, the query may not return any results. 

    To get the exact results, you would need to add the A3C FF hs model to the context or the knowledge graph. 

    Please note that the SPARQL query is just an example and may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure and data of the ORKG. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG, getting correct answers to the input question. 

    The query uses the `SELECT` clause to specify the variables to retrieve, the `WHERE` clause to define the query pattern, and the `FILTER` clause to filter the results based on the model name. 

    The `?paper` variable represents the paper entity, `?paperCode` represents the code link, and `?model` represents the model entity. 

    The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results based on the model name, which is set to "A3C FF hs". 

    The `str(?model) = "A3C FF hs"` condition checks if the model name is equal to "A3C FF hs". 

    If the model name matches, the query returns the corresponding paper and code link. 

    The query may not return any results if the A3C FF hs model is not present in the ORKG. 

    To get the exact results, you would need to add the A3C FF hs model to the context or the knowledge graph.
