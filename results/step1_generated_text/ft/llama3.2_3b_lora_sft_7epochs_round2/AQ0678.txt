 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                   rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "PWC Leaderboards (restricted)")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:P32               ?cont.
      ?cont         orkgp:HAS_PAPER        ?paper.
      ?paper      a                orkgp:Paper.
