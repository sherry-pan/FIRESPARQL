Question:
List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Story Cloze Test benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric?metric_lbl
     WHERE {
       orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?eval.
       FILTER (str(?eval) = "Evaluation")
      ?eval orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
      ?metric rdfs:label?metric_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?metric_lbl) = "Evaluation")
     }   

```

## Step 1: Understand the context and the question
The question asks to list the metrics used to evaluate models on the Story Cloze Test benchmark dataset. The context provides information about the terms mentioned in the question and candidate entities and properties in the ORKG.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant entities and properties
From the context, we can see that the relevant entities are "Story Cloze Test benchmark dataset" and "metrics", and the relevant property is "HAS_METRIC". We also need to use the "HAS_EVALUATION" property to link to the "Evaluation" metric.

## Step 3: Write the SPARQL query
We need to write a SPARQL query that selects the metric labels for the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the Story Cloze Test benchmark dataset. We can use the following query:
```
SELECT?metric?metric_lbl
WHERE {
  orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?eval.
  FILTER (str(?eval) = "Evaluation")
 ?eval orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
 ?metric rdfs:label?metric_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?metric_lbl) = "Evaluation")
}
```

The final answer is: 
SELECT?metric?metric_lbl
WHERE {
  orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?eval.
  FILTER (str(?eval) = "Evaluation")
 ?eval orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
 ?metric rdfs:label?metric_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?metric_lbl) = "Evaluation")
}   
```
Note: This is the exact output of the SPARQL query, as per the instructions. The final answer is the output of the query, not a numerical value.<|eot_id|>
