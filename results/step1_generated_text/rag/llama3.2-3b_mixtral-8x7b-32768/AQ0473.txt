Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Rotowire (Content Selection) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?title?id?paperid
     WHERE {
    ?paper?hasPaper?hasPaperLabel
     FILTER (bc:contains(?hasPaperLabel, "Contribution 1"))
    ?paper?hasTitle?hasTitleLabel
     FILTER (bc:contains(?hasTitleLabel, "Contribution 1"))
    ?paper?hasId?hasIdLabel
     FILTER (bc:contains(?hasIdLabel, "Contribution 1"))
    ?paper?hasBenchmark?hasBenchmarkLabel
     FILTER (bc:contains(?hasBenchmarkLabel, "performed benchmarks"))
    ?paper?hasDataset?hasDatasetLabel
     FILTER (bc:contains(?hasDatasetLabel, "Rotowire (Content Selection) dataset"))
    ?paper?hasPublication?hasPublicationLabel
     FILTER (bc:contains(?hasPublicationLabel, "Contribution 1"))
    ?paper?hasResource?hasResourceLabel
     FILTER (bc:contains(?hasResourceLabel, "Contribution 1"))
     }
     } 

```

## Step 1: Determine the entities and properties needed for the query
The query requires the following entities and properties: research papers, titles, IDs, Rotowire (Content Selection) dataset, performed benchmarks, and specific papers related to these entities.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant predicates from the context
The relevant predicates are: `hasPublication`, `hasContribution`, `hasTitle`, `hasID`, `hasDataset`, `hasBenchmark`,
