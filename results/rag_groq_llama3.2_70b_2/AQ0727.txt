To solve this task, we need to follow the steps outlined in the query. 

First, we extract the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The question mentions "evaluation metrics", "FSNS - Test dataset", and "benchmarking models". 

Next, we need to retrieve the top 10 similar entities or properties from the given RDF data dump based on cosine similarity scores. 

After analyzing the given RDF data dump, we find the following entities and properties that are similar to the ones mentioned in the question:

1. http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R212134 - This entity has a label "Evaluation" which is similar to "evaluation metrics" mentioned in the question.
2. http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R197479 - This entity also has a label "Evaluation" which is similar to "evaluation metrics" mentioned in the question.
3. http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R197737 - This entity has a label "A comparison of NLP tasks for Relation Extraction" which is related to "benchmarking models" mentioned in the question.
4. http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R197741 - This entity has a label "two listening comprehension tests -\"This Year's color\" and \"the shoplifter\" " which is not directly related to the question, but has a type "Material" which could be related to "dataset" mentioned in the question.
5. http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524 - This entity has a label "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire" which is related to "dataset" mentioned in the question.

The cosine similarity scores are calculated based on the similarity between the entities and properties mentioned in the question and the ones in the RDF data dump. 

Here is the output in JSON format:
