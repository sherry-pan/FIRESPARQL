Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PEGASUS model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P30?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P31?code.
      ?paper orkgp:P32?benchmark.
       FILTER(REGEX(?benchmark, "PEGASUS"))
     }
     ORDER BY DESC(COUNT(?code))
     LIMIT 10<|eot_id|>
