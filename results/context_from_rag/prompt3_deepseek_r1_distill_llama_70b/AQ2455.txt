Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking for a list of papers that have used the XLNet (base) model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information to find any mentions of XLNet. Scanning the provided RDF data, I don't see any direct references to XLNet. The context talks about models like SVM and datasets like MNIST, but XLNet isn't mentioned. 

Next, I check if there are any papers or resources related to models similar to XLNet. The context includes information about papers with authors like Ligia Sierra and others, but none of these papers mention XLNet. 

Since XLNet isn't present in the provided data, I can't extract any relevant terms or entities related to it. Therefore, there are no candidates to list, and the JSON output should reflect that with empty arrays for each term.

```json
{
    "question": "Provide a list of papers that have used the XLNet (base) model and include links to their code?",
    "extracted_terms": {
        "papers": [],
        "XLNet (base) model": [],
        "links to their code": []
    },
    "candidates": {
        "papers": [],
        "XLNet (base) model": [],
        "links to their code": []
    }
}
```
