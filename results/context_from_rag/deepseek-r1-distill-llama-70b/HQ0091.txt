Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to answer the question "What is Raman spectroscopy?" using the provided JSON properties. Let me start by understanding what Raman spectroscopy is. From what I remember, it's a technique used in chemistry and physics to identify materials based on the inelastic scattering of light. It involves shining a laser on a sample and analyzing the scattered light to determine the molecular composition.

Now, looking at the JSON properties, I need to find which ones are most relevant to explaining what Raman spectroscopy is. The properties are from the ORKG knowledge graph, so they might relate to methods, techniques, or specific terms in spectroscopy.

First, I see a property labeled "method" with the IRI "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_METHOD". This seems relevant because Raman spectroscopy is a method used in scientific analysis. It would help in explaining the technique aspect of it.

Next, there's a property labeled "causes" with the IRI "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/CAUSES". This could be useful in explaining the cause-effect relationship, such as how the laser causes the scattering of light, leading to the analysis of the material.

Another property is "affects" with the IRI "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/AFFECTS". This might be relevant when discussing how different factors (like the wavelength of the laser) affect the Raman spectrum obtained.

I also notice a property labeled "coexists with" with the IRI "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/COEXISTS_WITH". This could be useful in explaining how Raman spectroscopy coexists with other analytical techniques, perhaps as a complementary method.

There's a property labeled "compared with" with the IRI "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/COMPARED_WITH". This would help in comparing Raman spectroscopy with other spectroscopic methods, highlighting its unique features and applications.

Additionally, the property "evaluation" with the IRI "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_EVALUATION" could be relevant when discussing how Raman spectroscopy is evaluated or validated as an analytical tool.

I should also consider if there are any other properties that might be relevant, but from the list provided, these seem to cover the main aspects needed to explain what Raman spectroscopy is. Each of these properties can contribute to a comprehensive answer by addressing different facets of the technique.
