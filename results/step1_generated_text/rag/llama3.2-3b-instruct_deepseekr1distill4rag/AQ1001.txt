Question:
What are the metrics of evaluation over the iNaturalist 2019 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?p?o
WHERE {
 ?p a ora:EvaluationMetric.
 ?p ora:appliesTo?o.
 ?o ora:dataset?d.
 ?d ora:datasetName "iNaturalist 2019 dataset".
 ?p ora:technique ora:ValidationResearch.
 ?p ora:technique ora:validationResearch.
 ?p ora:technique ora:validationTechnique.
 ?p ora:technique ora:EvaluationTechnique.
 ?d ora:datasetName "MNIST".
}
``` 
    Note: The provided SPARQL query is just one possible query that can be generated based on the input question and context. There may be other valid queries that can be generated as well. 

    Note: The SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG, but it may not be compatible with all ORKG implementations. The query is written in a way that assumes the use of the ORKG RDF data dump, and the predicates and properties used may not be compatible with all ORKG implementations.
