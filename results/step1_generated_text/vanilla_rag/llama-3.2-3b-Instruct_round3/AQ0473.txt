Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Rotowire (Content Selection) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?title?id 
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:has_dataset orkg:has_benchmark orkg:has_evaluation orkg:has_method {
    ?paper orkg:has_dataset <http://example.org/rotowire-content-selection>.
     }
     }<|eot_id|>
