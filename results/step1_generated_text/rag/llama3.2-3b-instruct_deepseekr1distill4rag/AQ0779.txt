Question:
What are the metrics of evaluation over the Fashion-MNIST dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
     PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
     SELECT?p?o?label
     WHERE {
    ?p a orkgp:Predicate.
    ?p orkgp:label?label.
     FILTER (CONTAINS(?label, "metrics of evaluation") OR CONTAINS(?label, "F1-score") OR CONTAINS(?label, "accuracy") OR CONTAINS(?label, "validation research") OR CONTAINS(?label, "Journal Article")).
    ?o a orkgc:Resource.
    ?o orkgp:label?label.
     FILTER (CONTAINS(?label, "Fashion-MNIST dataset") OR CONTAINS(?label, "MNIST") OR CONTAINS(?label, "AIDA") OR CONTAINS(?label, "MEANTIME") OR CONTAINS(?label, "Journal Article")).
     }
    Note: The SPARQL query is case-sensitive. The exact terms in the question are not present in the context, but the query is designed to match the extracted terms and their corresponding candidates. 

This SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the correct answer to the input question by querying the ORKG. The query first identifies the relevant predicates and resources based on the extracted terms. It then filters the results to include only those that contain the specified terms. The query is case-sensitive, but it is designed to match the extracted terms and their corresponding candidates. 

Please note that the actual query might need to be adjusted based on the specific structure and content of the ORKG RDF data dump. 

The query uses the following prefixes:

- orkgr: for resources
- orkgp: for properties
- orkgc: for classes

The query also uses the following filters:

- CONTAINS to match the exact term or a substring
- FILTER to filter the results based on the conditions specified

The query returns the following variables:

-?p: the predicate
-?o: the resource
-?label: the label of the predicate or resource

The query is designed to retrieve the correct answer to the input question by matching the extracted terms and their corresponding candidates.
