Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the ImageNet + iNat on WS-DAN model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?code
WHERE {
  orkgp:R123456 orkgp:R123457
  orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK orkgp:HAS_CODE
  orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
  FILTER(REGEX(?benchmark, "ImageNet + iNat on WS-DAN"))
 ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_CODE?code.
}
``` 
    Note that the actual input question, extracted terms, and candidates provided as context may change. You will have to update the SPARQL query accordingly.
    The code used in the papers that benchmark the ImageNet + iNat on WS-DAN model should be retrieved. The code is linked to the papers that have benchmarked the ImageNet + iNat on WS-DAN model. The benchmarked model is also linked to the model. The code is linked to the model.
    The actual URIs of the model, papers, and benchmark may vary. The URIs are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual URIs in the SPARQL query.
    The SPARQL query may need to be updated to handle different cases or scenarios.
    If the question is not answered by the current SPARQL query, the query should be modified to include additional filters or conditions to get the correct answer.
