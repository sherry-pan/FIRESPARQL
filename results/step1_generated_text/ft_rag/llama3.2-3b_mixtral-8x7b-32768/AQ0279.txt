Question:
What are the models that have been benchmarked on the Atari 2600 Road Runner dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
           FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Road Runner")
          ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
          ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
          ?model        orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?cont.
          ?model      rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
     } 

    Note that the answer to the question is the list of models that have been benchmarked on the Atari 2600 Road Runner dataset. The answer will be a list of URIs and their corresponding labels. 

    Here's an explanation of the SPARQL query:
    The query first filters the dataset labels to get only the "Atari 2600 Road Runner" dataset. 
    Then, it gets the models that have been benchmarked on this dataset by traversing the "HAS_DATASET" and "HAS_BENCHMARK" relationships. 
    Finally, it gets the labels of these models by traversing the "HAS_MODEL" and "RDFS:label" relationships. 
    The query outputs the URIs and labels of the models that have been benchmarked on the Atari 2600 Road Runner dataset. 

    Note that the output format is (URI, Label). 

    Example output:
    (orkgp:R1, "Model 1")
    (orkgp:R2, "Model 2")
    (orkgp:R3, "Model 3") 
    where orkp:R1, orkp:R2, orkp:R3 are URIs of the models. 

    This query will return the models that have been benchmarked on the Atari 2600 Road Runner dataset. 

    The answer will be a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the URI and label of a model. 

    The ORKG provides the following predicates for the following relationships:
    - orkgp:HAS_DATASET: A model has been benchmarked on a dataset.
    - orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK: A benchmark has been performed on a model.
    - orkgp:HAS_MODEL: A model has been trained on a task. 
    - orkgc:Dataset: A dataset is a collection of data.
    - orkgc:Resource: A resource is a thing that has an identity. 
    - rdfs:label: A resource has a label. 
    - rdfs:type: A resource has a type.
