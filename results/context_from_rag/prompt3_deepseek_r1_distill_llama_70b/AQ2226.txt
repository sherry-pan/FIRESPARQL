Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the XLNet-Large model?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "papers" and "XLNet-Large model." The property mentioned is "benchmark," which relates papers to the model they benchmark. So, the extracted terms are "papers," "XLNet-Large model," and "benchmark."

Next, I need to find similar entities or properties in the RDF data. Looking through the context, I see that there are resources related to papers, such as R147246 and R283710, which have authors and publication details. However, I don't see any direct mention of "XLNet-Large" or specific benchmarking relations. 

I'll look for properties that relate papers to models or benchmarking. The predicates like P27 (authors), P28 (issue), P29 (year), and HAS_VENUE might be relevant for papers. For benchmarking, I might consider properties like P5044 (Journal Article) or P41924 (scholarly domain), but these don't directly link to models.

Since the data doesn't explicitly mention "XLNet-Large," I'll consider related models or datasets. For example, R147652 describes a method involving SVM and MNIST, which are related to machine learning models and datasets. This could be a candidate for benchmarking, even if it's not XLNet specifically.

I'll also check for any resources that mention models or benchmarking. R283709 talks about methods like keyphrase extraction and named entity recognition, which are NLP tasks, possibly related to models like XLNet.

Now, I'll select the top candidates for each extracted term. For "papers," R147246 and R283710 are specific papers with authors and details. For "XLNet-Large model," since it's not present, I'll look for similar models or related resources like R147652. For "benchmark," I'll consider properties that relate to evaluations or methods, such as P5044 or P41924.

I need to structure the JSON output correctly, using the appropriate RDF prefixes and including types. Each candidate should have a URI, label, and type. Since the exact model isn't found, I'll include the closest related resources.

Finally, I'll ensure the JSON is properly formatted, grouping the results under each extracted term and including the necessary details for each candidate.
