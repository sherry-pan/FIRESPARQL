Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the MMV model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper orkgp:P30?cont.
      ?cont. rdfs:label?paper_title.
       FILTER(REGEX(?paper_title, "MMV"))
      ?paper orkgp:P31?code.
     }<|eot_id|>
