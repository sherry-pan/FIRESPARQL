Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the Atari 2600 Venture dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Venture")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                 rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
}
```<|eot_id|>
