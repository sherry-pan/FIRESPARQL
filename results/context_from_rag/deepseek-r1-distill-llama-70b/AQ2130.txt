Okay, so I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question: "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Large mLSTM model and include the links to their code?" 

First, I'll break down the question. It's asking for papers that used a specific model (Large mLSTM) and wants links to their code. So, I need properties related to papers, their methods, implementations, and possibly where they're mentioned or linked.

Looking at the JSON properties, I see a lot of them are about various aspects like evaluation, datasets, methods, etc. Let me go through them one by one.

1. "method" (HAS_METHOD): This seems relevant because the question is about a specific method or model used in papers. If a paper uses the Large mLSTM, their method section would mention it.

2. "implementation" (HAS_IMPLEMENTATION): This is directly related to code. If a paper provides code, this property would link to it.

3. "evaluation" (HAS_EVALUATION): While this is more about results, sometimes evaluations include mentions of models used, so it could be useful.

4. "has dataset" (HAS_DATASET): If the model was used with specific datasets, this might help identify relevant papers.

5. "approach" (HAS_APPROACH): Similar to method, this could describe how the model was applied in the paper.

6. "has benchmark" (HAS_BENCHMARK): Benchmarks often compare different models, so if Large mLSTM is a benchmark, this could point to relevant papers.

7. "affects" (AFFECTS): This might be too vague, but could relate to how the model affects certain outcomes.

8. "causes" (CAUSES): Also a bit vague, but might link the model to specific effects or results.

9. "coexists with" (COEXISTS_WITH): Could indicate other models or tools used alongside Large mLSTM.

10. "compared with" (COMPARED_WITH): If the paper compares Large mLSTM with other models, this property would be useful.

11. "name" (CSVW_Name): This might refer to the name of the model or paper, so could help in identifying relevant entries.

12. "value" (CSVW_Value): Not sure, but could relate to specific values or metrics associated with the model.

13. "data" (DATA): General, but could include information about the model's usage.

14. "has mesh" (HAS_MESH): Not sure what this refers to, maybe not relevant.

15. "cells", "columns", "rows", "titles" (CSVW related): These seem more about data structure, maybe not directly relevant unless the data includes model info.

16. "number" (CSVW_Number): Could be about counts, but not directly helpful.

17. "columns" (CSVW_Columns): Again, more about data structure.

18. "rows" (CSVW_Rows): Same as above.

19. "titles" (CSVW_Titles): Could refer to paper titles, which might mention the model.

20. "cells" (CSVW_Cells): Data cells, probably not relevant.

So, focusing on the most relevant ones: method, implementation, evaluation, has dataset, approach, has benchmark, affects, causes, coexists with, compared with, name, value, data, titles.

These properties can help identify papers that used the model and provide links to their code through implementation or dataset links.
