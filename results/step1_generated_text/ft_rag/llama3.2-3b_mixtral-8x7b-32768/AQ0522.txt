Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the MPQA dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "MPQA")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
      ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                      rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
     }
