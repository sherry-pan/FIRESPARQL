Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the Atari 2600 Skiing dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?m?d
WHERE {
 ?m a orkgp:Model.
 ?m orkgp:evaluatedOn?d.
  filter (str(?d) = "Atari 2600 Skiing" @lang="en").
}
```    Note: The `@lang="en"` is used to specify the language of the string literal. The `filter` function is used to restrict the results to only those where the string value of the `d` property matches the specified string. 

    If you need to run the query, you can copy the SPARQL query into your favorite SPARQL query editor or run it using a SPARQL endpoint.<|eot_id|>
