Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the SQuAD2.0 dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data. 

First, I'll break down the question. The key terms here are "evaluation metrics" and "SQuAD2.0 dataset." I need to find entities and properties related to these in the RDF data.

Looking at the context, I see several resources and predicates. For example, R147244 has a HAS_VALUE of "93.9", which might be an evaluation metric. R147246 is connected to authors and a venue, which might not be directly relevant. R283709 and R283710 describe a publication with various predicates like P3000, which mentions "Graph analytics; Horizon 2020; Keyphrase..." but I'm not sure if that's relevant here.

I need to find entities related to evaluation metrics. Maybe R147244 is one since it has a value. Also, looking for properties like HAS_VALUE or P27, which might link to metrics.

Next, I should look for the SQuAD2.0 dataset. I don't see it explicitly mentioned, but maybe it's related to other datasets like MNIST, which is mentioned in Step 1 of R147656. If SQuAD2.0 is a benchmark, perhaps it's linked via a predicate like P39028 or similar.

I'll extract terms like "evaluation metrics" and "SQuAD2.0 dataset." Then, I'll search the RDF for entities and properties matching these. Since the exact dataset isn't present, I might infer based on similar benchmarks.

I'll list the top candidates. For "evaluation metrics," R147244 with HAS_VALUE "93.9" seems relevant. For "SQuAD2.0 dataset," maybe R147656 is a close match as it's a benchmark. I'll include a few more from the data that might be related, even if not exact.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their candidates, ensuring the correct prefixes and types are used.
