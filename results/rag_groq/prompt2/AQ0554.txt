Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "research papers" and "Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset". The properties involved are "include a benchmark for".

Looking at the context, I see two main resources: R147246 and R284317. Both are research papers. R147246 has authors like Ligia Sierra and others, published in 2015. R284317 is from 2021 with authors Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta, and it's about extracting entity knowledge using NLP techniques.

I need to check if either of these papers mentions the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset. From the context, R284316 discusses entity recognition and linking, using datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP. There's no mention of Oxford-IIIT Pets. Similarly, R147246 doesn't reference it either.

Since neither paper explicitly mentions the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset, there are no matches. Therefore, the candidates list will be empty for both extracted terms.
