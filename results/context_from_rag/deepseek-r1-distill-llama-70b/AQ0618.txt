Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to answer the question: "List the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the Atari 2600 Frostbite dataset?" using the provided JSON properties. 

First, I need to break down the question. It's asking for two specific pieces of information: the title and ID of research papers. Additionally, these papers should contain a benchmark using the Atari 2600 Frostbite dataset.

Looking at the JSON properties, I see several that might be relevant. 

1. **Title and ID**: The question specifically asks for the title and ID of papers. In the JSON, there are properties like "title" and "id" which seem directly relevant. These would help retrieve the necessary information about each paper.

2. **Benchmark**: The papers need to have a benchmark. The JSON includes a property labeled "benchmark" with the IRI "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/HAS_BENCHMARK". This seems crucial because it indicates that the paper uses or is associated with a benchmark.

3. **Dataset**: The question mentions the Atari 2600 Frostbite dataset. While the JSON doesn't explicitly mention this dataset, there's a property called "dataset" with the label "has dataset". This could be used to filter papers that use specific datasets, even if the exact name isn't listed.

4. **Evaluation**: Since benchmarks are often part of evaluations, the property "evaluation" (from "HAS_EVALUATION") might also be relevant. It could provide context on how the benchmark was used or presented in the paper.

Putting it all together, the most relevant properties would be those that provide the title, ID, benchmark information, dataset usage, and evaluation details. These properties would help in identifying the specific papers that match the criteria.

The most relevant properties from the JSON file to answer the question are:

1. **Title**: To retrieve the title of the research papers.
2. **ID**: To obtain the unique identifier of each paper.
3. **Benchmark**: Indicates that the paper uses or is associated with a benchmark.
4. **Dataset**: Helps identify papers that use specific datasets, including the Atari 2600 Frostbite dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Provides context on how the benchmark was used or presented in the paper.

These properties collectively help in identifying and retrieving the required information about the research papers.
