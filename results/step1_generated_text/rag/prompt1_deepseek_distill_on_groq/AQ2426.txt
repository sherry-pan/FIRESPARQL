Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given ORKG RDF data. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the DY-MobileNetV3-Small model and include links to their code. 

First, I should extract the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The main entity here is "DY-MobileNetV3-Small model." I'm looking for papers that have used this model and have code links.

Looking at the provided context, I see several resources labeled as "Paper." For example, R211524 is a paper titled "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire." Another one is R211922, titled "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)." There's also R211327, which is another paper but without a specific title in the context. 

I need to check if any of these papers mention the DY-MobileNetV3-Small model. However, from the given data, I don't see any direct mention of this model. The papers seem to be about NLP tasks, not computer vision models like MobileNet. 

Since the context doesn't have any information about the DY-MobileNetV3-Small model or papers using it, I can't retrieve any relevant entities. Therefore, the top similar entities based on the question's context would be the papers listed, but none are related to the specific model mentioned.

So, the answer would be an empty list because there's no matching data in the provided context.

The query seeks papers using the DY-MobileNetV3-Small model with code links. However, the provided context doesn't mention this model or related papers. Thus, no relevant entities are found.
