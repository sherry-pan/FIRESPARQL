To solve this task, we'll follow the steps outlined:

1. **Extract entities and properties from the question**: The key entities and properties mentioned in the question are "models" and "ACE 2005 dataset". 

2. **Retrieve similar entities or properties from the RDF data dump**: Since the provided RDF data dump does not directly mention "ACE 2005 dataset" or explicitly list models benchmarked on it, we'll look for entities related to "models" and any mentions of datasets or evaluations that could be relevant.

3. **Calculate cosine similarity scores**: Given the nature of the task and the data provided, we'll simplify the calculation by looking for exact matches or close semantic matches between the question's keywords and the labels of entities/properties in the RDF data.

Based on the provided RDF data, here are the top 5 similar entities or properties, considering the simplification due to the lack of direct relevance to "ACE 2005 dataset" and focusing on entities related to models or evaluations:

```json
[
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211922",
    "label": "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)",
    "score": 0.8
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524",
    "label": "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire",
    "score": 0.7
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R212134",
    "label": "Evaluation",
    "score": 0.6
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R44252",
    "label": "BioBERT achieved the highest F1 scores",
    "score": 0.5
  },
  {
    "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R44243",
    "label": "captures the meaning of the correlation between words based on multi-head attention",
    "score": 0.4
  }
]
```

**Note**: The scores are hypothetical and based on a simplified semantic matching approach, as the actual calculation of cosine similarity would require vector representations of the question and the entities/properties, which is not directly feasible with the provided data in this format. The selection of entities is based on their relevance to "models" and evaluation or dataset contexts.
