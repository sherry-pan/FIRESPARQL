```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT ?paper ?code
WHERE {
  ?model a orkgc:Model;
         rdfs:label ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "Flair-TDM")
  
  ?cont orkgp:HAS_MODEL ?model;
        orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE ?code;
        orkgp:HAS_PAPER ?paper.
}
```

Note: This assumes the existence of the `orkgp:HAS_PAPER` property, which is necessary to link each contribution (`?cont`) to a paper (`?paper`). If this property is not available, the correct SPARQL query may require additional information about how papers are related in the data model.
