Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given context. The query is asking for a list of papers that used AlexNet and MultiGrasp, including code links. But looking at the context provided, I don't see any mentions of AlexNet or MultiGrasp. The context has information about papers like "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire" and "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)", but none of these seem related to the models mentioned in the query.

First, I should extract the entities and properties from the question. The key terms here are "papers", "AlexNet", "MultiGrasp model", and "code links". Now, I need to look through the context to find similar entities or properties. The context lists several papers, each with their URIs and labels. However, none of these papers mention AlexNet or MultiGrasp. 

Since the context doesn't have any information related to the models in the query, there are no similar entities to retrieve. Therefore, the top 5 similar entities would be an empty list because there's no relevant data in the provided context.

The query asks for papers using AlexNet and MultiGrasp, but the context doesn't mention these models. Thus, no similar entities are found.
