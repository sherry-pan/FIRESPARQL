Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the datasets benchmarked under the Common Sense Reasoning research problem?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "Common Sense Reasoning" as the research problem and "datasets" that are benchmarked under it. The property involved is "benchmarked under," which describes the relationship between the datasets and the research problem.

Next, I need to find similar entities or properties in the RDF data. Looking through the context, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there's a resource R147652 which has multiple steps described, and R147244 with a value of "93.9". There are also resources related to journal articles, such as R283709 and R283710, which mention things like "Graph analytics" and "Named entity recognition."

I'm looking for terms related to "Common Sense Reasoning" and "datasets." In the context, I don't see any direct mentions of "Common Sense Reasoning," but there are mentions of "Named entity recognition" and "Keyphrase extraction," which are related to NLP tasks. There's also a mention of "Benchmark" in the example output, which might be relevant.

Since "Common Sense Reasoning" isn't explicitly mentioned, I might need to look for related concepts. However, in the given data, I don't see any resources or predicates that directly correspond to it. Therefore, I might have to consider that the data doesn't contain information on this specific research problem.

For the datasets, I can look for resources of type "Dataset." In the context, I see mentions of "MNIST" and "SVM" in the steps, but those are more about models and datasets used in examples. There's also a resource R283709 which is a journal article, but it's not a dataset.

Given that, I might have to conclude that there are no datasets benchmarked under "Common Sense Reasoning" in the provided data. Alternatively, if there are any datasets mentioned, they might be indirectly related, but without explicit links, it's hard to determine.

I should structure the JSON output as per the example, grouping the results by the extracted terms. Since I couldn't find any relevant datasets or properties related to "Common Sense Reasoning," the candidates for each term would be empty or non-existent in the provided context.

I need to make sure to use the correct RDF prefixes and include the necessary types. Each candidate should have a URI, label, and type. If no candidates are found, the lists will be empty.

In summary, after extracting the terms and searching through the context, it appears there's no direct information available on datasets benchmarked under "Common Sense Reasoning." Therefore, the JSON output will reflect that with empty candidate lists for each extracted term.
