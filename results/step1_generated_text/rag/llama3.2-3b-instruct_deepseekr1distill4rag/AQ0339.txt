Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the PROTEINS dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
    PREFIX orkc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/classification/>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/predicate/>
    PREFIX orkd: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/dataset/>

    SELECT?model (COUNT(?model) AS?count) 
    WHERE {
     ?model a orkg:Model.
     ?model orkp:evaluated_on?dataset.
      FILTER (?dataset = <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/dataset/PROTEINS_dataset>)
    }
    ``` 
    If there are multiple answers, provide one answer per line. 

    Please note that the above output is not the complete SPARQL query. It is just a part of it. You may need to add more parts to it. 

    Also, the actual SPARQL query will depend on the actual RDF data in the ORKG. The above output is based on the provided context and RDF data dump. 

    If you need to add more parts to the query, you can do so by adding more `WHERE` clauses. 

    The `COUNT` function is used to count the number of models that have been evaluated on the PROTEINS dataset. 

    Please note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be modified to handle any errors or inconsistencies in the RDF data. 

    The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include models that have been evaluated on the PROTEINS dataset. 

    The `<http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/dataset/PROTEINS_dataset>` is a placeholder for the actual URI of the PROTEINS dataset. 

    You may need to replace this with the actual URI of the PROTEINS dataset. 

    The `SELECT` clause is used to specify the variables that should be returned in the results. 

    In this case, the `?model` variable is selected, along with the count of models that have been evaluated on the PROTEINS dataset. 

    The `?count` variable is used to store the count of models. 

    The `COUNT` function is used to count the number of models that have been evaluated on the PROTEINS dataset. 

    The `WHERE` clause is used to specify the conditions under which the query should be executed. 

    In this case, the query is executed for all models that have been evaluated on the PROTEINS dataset. 

    The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include models that have been evaluated on the PROTEINS dataset.
