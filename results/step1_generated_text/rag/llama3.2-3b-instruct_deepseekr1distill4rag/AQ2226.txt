Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the XLNet-Large model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    SELECT?paper?model?link
    WHERE {
     ?paper orkgr:papers "R284317".
     ?paper orkgr:has_benchmark "XLNet-Large".
     ?paper orkgr:has_code?link.
     ?model orkgr:has_name "Named Entity Recognition and Classification".
     ?model orkgr:is_model_of "NERC".
     ?link orkgp:url?url.
     ?link orkgp:P26?doi.
      BIND(STR(?url) AS?link_url).
      BIND(STR(?doi) AS?link_doi)
    }
    ``` 
    Note: The actual SPARQL query may require adjustments based on the actual RDF data and prefixes used in the ORKG. This response is based on the provided context and may not be the optimal solution. 

    In this example, the query is designed to find papers that benchmark the XLNet-Large model, retrieve the code used in those papers, and identify the URLs and DOIs of those codes. The query uses the `orkgr` prefix for the ORKG resources and `orkgp` prefix for the ORKG properties. The `SELECT` clause retrieves the paper, model, and link URIs. The `WHERE` clause filters papers that benchmark the XLNet-Large model, retrieves the code used in those papers, and identifies the URLs and DOIs of those codes. The `BIND` function is used to format the URLs and DOIs as strings. 

    Please note that this is a hypothetical example and may need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data and prefixes used in the ORKG. 

    To generate the actual SPARQL query, you would need to replace the prefixes, URIs, and labels with the actual values from the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Additionally, the query may require additional joins or filters based on the actual structure of the ORKG data. 

    It is recommended to consult the ORKG documentation and the actual RDF data dump to ensure the generated SPARQL query is accurate and effective.
