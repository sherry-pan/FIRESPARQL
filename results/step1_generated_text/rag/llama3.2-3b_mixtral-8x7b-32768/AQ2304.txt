Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the Rational DQN Average model?

    Note: The provided SPARQL query assumes that the `Rational DQN Average model` is a code used in papers that benchmark the model. If the `Rational DQN Average model` is not a code used in papers that benchmark the model, the query will not return the correct results. 

    The query is written in a way that it first finds papers that benchmark the `Rational DQN Average model`, then finds the code used in those papers, and finally filters the results to include only the code used in papers that benchmark the `Rational DQN Average model`. 

    The query uses the `orkgp:HAS_CODE` predicate to link the code used in papers to the `Rational DQN Average model`, and the `orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION` predicate to link papers to benchmarking. 

    The query also uses the `orkgp:HAS_CODE` predicate to link the code used in papers to the code used in the benchmarking, and the `orkw:label` predicate to get the label of the code used in papers. 

    The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to include only the code used in papers that benchmark the `Rational DQN Average model`. 

    The query assumes that the `Rational DQN Average model` is a code used in papers that benchmark the model. If the `Rational DQN Average model` is not a code used in papers that benchmark the model, the query will not return the correct results.
