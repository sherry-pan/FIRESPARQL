Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the ObjectNet dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

SELECT?p?paper?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgr:hasDescription?description.
  FILTER (STRLIKE(STR(?description), "benchmarking")).
 ?paper orkgr:hasDataset?dataset.
  FILTER (STRLIKE(STR(?dataset), "ObjectNet")).
 ?paper orkgr:hasAuthor?author.
 ?paper orkgr:hasPublication?pub.
 ?pub orkgr:hasVolume?volume.
 ?paper orkgr:hasID?id.
 ?paper orkgr:hasTitle?title.
 ?paper a orkgc:Research_Paper.
}
```    Note: The prefixes are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual URIs from the ORKG RDF data dump. The actual SPARQL query will depend on the structure of the RDF data. This query is an example based on the provided context. 

    To generate the SPARQL query, you can use a natural language processing (NLP) library to extract the relevant terms from the input question, and then use a knowledge graph reasoning engine to compute the similarity between these terms and the entities in the RDF data. The top-ranked candidates are then used to construct the SPARQL query. The query is then optimized to retrieve the desired information from the RDF data. 

    The actual SPARQL query will depend on the structure of the RDF data, and the prefixes used will need to be replaced with the actual URIs from the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    The output of the SPARQL query will be a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the ObjectNet dataset. 

    The SPARQL query can be executed on the ORKG RDF data dump to retrieve the results. 

    The results will be in the format of a list of JSON objects, where each object contains the title, ID, authors, publication details, and score of a research paper. 

    The JSON output will be structured as follows:

    ```json
{
  "title": "Research Paper Title",
  "id": "Research Paper ID",
  "authors": ["Author 1", "Author 2"],
  "publication": {
    "volume": "Volume Number",
    "year": "Year of Publication"
  },
  "score": "Score"
}
```

    This format allows for easy parsing and processing of the results. 

    The SPARQL query can be modified and optimized as needed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the results. 

    The use of natural language processing and knowledge graph reasoning engines can help to improve the accuracy and relevance of the results. 

    The SPARQL query can be executed on the ORKG RDF data dump to retrieve the results, and the results can be further processed and analyzed as needed. 

    The output of the SPARQL query can be used to generate a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the ObjectNet dataset. 

    This can be useful for a variety of applications, such as research paper recommendation systems, academic search engines, and knowledge graph-based question answering systems.
