Okay, I need to figure out the data format of the CHEMDNER corpus. Let me start by looking through the provided context information.

First, I'll scan the RDF data for any mentions of CHEMDNER. I see that the context includes information about various resources, but I don't immediately see any references to CHEMDNER. The resources mentioned are about methods, datasets like MNIST, and some research papers with authors and venues.

Looking at the predicates and objects, there's information about steps in a method involving NER and entity linking, but nothing about data formats. The context also includes some metrics like "93.9" and venues like Italy, but again, nothing about CHEMDNER.

Since the context doesn't provide any details about the CHEMDNER corpus, I can't extract any relevant terms or compute similarities. Without information about the data format, I can't generate the required JSON output.

I should inform the user that the context doesn't contain the necessary information to answer the question about the CHEMDNER corpus's data format.

The context provided does not contain information about the CHEMDNER corpus or its data format. Therefore, it's not possible to determine the data format based on the given data.

```json
{
  "question": "What data format does CHEMDNER corpus have?",
  "extracted_terms": [],
  "candidates": {}
}
```
