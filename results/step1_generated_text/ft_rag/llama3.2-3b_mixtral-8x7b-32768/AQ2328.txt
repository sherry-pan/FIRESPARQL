Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the MFEC model?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?model    orkgp:P31   ?model_label.
       FILTER (str(?model_label) = "MFEC")
      ?model    orkgp:P32   ?benchmark.
      ?benchmark    orkgp:P33   ?cont.
      ?cont        orkgp:HAS_CODE   ?code.
      ?code        rdfs:label   ?code_label.
       FILTER (str(?code_label) = "code")
       }     


    The provided SPARQL query fetches the code used in papers that benchmark the MFEC model. The query first filters the models to only include the MFEC model. It then filters the benchmarks to only include those that are linked to the MFEC model. The query then filters the containers to only include those that have code, and finally retrieves the code. The filter on the code label ensures that only code is returned. 

    The query uses the following properties and predicates from the ORKG:
    - orkgp:P31 (instance of)
    - orkgp:P32 (subClassOf)
    - orkgp:P33 (containing)
    - orkgp:HAS_CODE (has code)
    - rdfs:label (label)
    - rdfs:label (label)
    - orkgp:P33 (containing)
    - orkgp:P33 (containing)
    - orkgp:HAS_CODE (has code)
    - rdfs:label (label)

    The query is designed to retrieve the code used in papers that benchmark the MFEC model. The query is able to handle the context provided, as it correctly filters the models, benchmarks, containers, and code to retrieve the desired output. 

    The query is not able to handle any additional context or entities that are not explicitly mentioned in the question. 

    The query is able to handle the following entities and properties:
    - MFEC model
    - papers
    - benchmark
    - code
    - orkgp:P31 (instance of)
    - orkgp:P32 (subClassOf)
    - orkgp:P33 (containing)
    - orkgp:HAS_CODE (has code)
    - rdfs:label (label)
    The query is able to handle the following relationships:
    - a model is an instance of (model) and a model is a subclass of (model, model)
    - a model is contained in (model, container)
    - a container contains code (container, code)
    - a container has code (container, code)
