Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the CUB-200-2011 dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "research papers" and "CUB-200-2011 dataset". The property mentioned is "include a benchmark for".

Looking through the context, I see that there are two main resources: R147246 and R283710. Both are papers with their respective authors and publication details. 

I need to find if either of these papers mentions the CUB-200-2011 dataset. However, in the provided data, I don't see any direct mention of "CUB-200-2011". The context talks about datasets like MNIST and methods like SVM, but not CUB-200-2011.

Since there's no explicit mention, I'll have to consider that the data might not contain the specific benchmark the question is asking about. Therefore, the candidates for "CUB-200-2011 dataset" would be empty.

For "research papers", both R147246 and R283710 are relevant. Each has a title and ID, so I'll include those in the candidates.

The property "include a benchmark for" would relate to how papers are connected to benchmarks. In the context, P31 and HAS_VENUE are used, but they don't directly represent including a benchmark. So, I'll map this to a general property like "orkgp:P31".

Putting it all together, the JSON structure should group the extracted terms and their candidates accordingly.
