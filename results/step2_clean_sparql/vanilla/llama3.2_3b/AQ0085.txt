  ?evaluation wmt:dataset "WMT2016 English-German".
}
```

The query has been cleaned up to focus on retrieving the models evaluated on WMT2016 English-German dataset. Unnecessary components like the `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `FILTER`, and `HAVING` clauses that were not relevant or optimally used were removed. The new query utilizes `DISTINCT` to ensure each model is listed only once. Note that prefixes and specific predicates will need to be verified against your data source, as "wmt:" and certain predicates like `dbo:evaluationOf` are assumed identifiers and may differ in your implementation.
