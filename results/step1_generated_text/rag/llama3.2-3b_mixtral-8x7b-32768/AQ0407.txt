Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the SciERC dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    SELECT?title?id?benchmark
    WHERE {
   ?p?o orkg:relatedTo "orkgr:R131168".
   ?p orkgp:hasModel?m.
   ?m orkgp:hasBenchmark?b.
    FILTER (regex(str(?o), ".*paper.*") && regex(str(?b), ".*model.*"))
    }
    ``` 
    Given the provided context, what is the correct SPARQL query? 

## Step 1: Understand the context
The context provides information about the entities and properties mentioned in the input question. It includes terms, candidate entities and properties, and their corresponding URIs.

## Step 2: Identify relevant entities and properties
From the context, we can identify the following relevant entities and properties:
- Research paper titles and IDs
- Benchmarked models
- SciERC dataset
- orkg:relatedTo
- orkgp:hasModel
- orkgp:hasBenchmark

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query
To generate the SPARQL query, we need to connect the relevant entities and properties to the input question. The query should retrieve research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the SciERC dataset.

## Step 4: Write the SPARQL query
Based on the relevant entities and properties, the SPARQL query can be constructed as follows:
```
SELECT?title?id?benchmark
WHERE {
 ?p?o orkg:relatedTo "orkgr:R131168".
 ?p orkgp:hasModel?m.
 ?m orkgp:hasBenchmark?b.
  FILTER (regex(str(?o), ".*paper.*") && regex(str(?
