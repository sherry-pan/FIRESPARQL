Question:
What are the metrics of evaluation over the Atari 2600 Tutankham dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
     PREFIX orkg: <http://orkgr.org/resource/>
     PREFIX orkgc: <http://orkgc.org/resource/>
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://orkgp.org/resource/>
     
     SELECT?metric?dataset 
     WHERE {
     ?dataset a orkgc:Dataset.
     ?dataset orkgc:hasMetric?metric.
     ?metric orkgp:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
     ?evaluation orkgp:hasDataset?dataset.
     ?dataset orkgr:R122689.
     ?metric orkgp:HAS_METRIC.
     ?metric orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION.
    }
    ```


    Note: You do not need to provide any explanation for the solution, the output is the final answer. 

    If you have any question or need further clarification, feel free to ask. 

    The code should be able to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question. 

    The final answer is the SPARQL query. 

    Let me know if I can assist you with anything else. 

    Thank you.
