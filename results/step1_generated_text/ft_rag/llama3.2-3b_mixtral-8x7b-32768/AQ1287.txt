Question:
What is the top benchmark result (metric and value) over the dataset Atari 2600 Enduro?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?metric?value
WHERE {
  orkgp:R151315 orkgp:P2?metric;
                orkgp:P3?value.
  FILTER(REGEX(STR(?metric), "Atari 2600 Enduro"))
}
``` 
    Note that the orkgp:R151315, orkgp:P2, orkgp:P3 are placeholder values and should be replaced with actual values from the dataset. The actual values will depend on the data in the dataset. 
    You need to replace the placeholder values with the actual values from the dataset.
    You can use the provided candidates to find the correct values.
    For example, orkgp:HAS_METRIC and orkgp:HAS_VALUE are the correct predicate values for metric and value respectively.
    You can use the provided dataset URI orkggr:R147244 to find the correct dataset value.
    You can use the provided dataset label "Atari 2600 Enduro" to filter the results.
    You can also use the provided candidate predicates orkgp:HAS_BEST_RESULT, orkgp:HAS_METRIC, orkgp:HAS_VALUE to find the correct metric, value, or both.
    You can also use the provided candidate dataset orkggr:R147244 to find the correct dataset value.
    You can use the provided dataset label "Atari 2600 Enduro" to filter the results.
