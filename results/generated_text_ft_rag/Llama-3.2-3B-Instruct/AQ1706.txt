Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Score metric on the Atari 2600 Asteroids benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
 ?metric     a       orkgc:Metric;
              rdfs:label ?metric_lbl.
}
UNION
{
SELECT?model?model_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Asteroids")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont          orkgp:P31               ?model.
 ?model        rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
}
}
ORDER BY DESC(?score)
LIMIT 5
``` 
    Note: The provided SPARQL query is a modified version of the one provided in the original solution. It includes the `ORDER BY DESC(?score)` and `LIMIT 5` clauses to sort the results by score in descending order and return the top 5 models, respectively. 

    The query is designed to find the model that performed best in terms of the Score metric on the Atari 2600 Asteroids dataset. It first selects all metrics and their labels, and then unions this with a separate query that filters for the Atari 2600 Asteroids dataset and selects the model and its label. The results are then sorted by score in descending order and limited to the top 5 models. 

    Note that the `str(?dataset_lbl) = "Atari 2600 Asteroids"` filter is used to ensure that only the dataset with the exact label "Atari 2600 Asteroids" is selected. 

    The query assumes that the ORKG data dump is available and that the necessary predicates and labels are defined. 

    The query returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the URI and label of a model that performed well on the Atari 2600 Asteroids dataset. 

    The query can be executed using a SPARQL query engine or a tool that supports SPARQL queries. 

    The output of the query will be a JSON list of tuples, where each tuple represents a model that performed well on the Atari 2600 Asteroids dataset. 

    The JSON list will contain the following properties for each model: 

    - `uri`: The URI of the model. 

    - `label`: The label of the model. 

    - `score`: The score of the model on the Atari 2600 Asteroids dataset. 

    The `score` property is not explicitly defined in the query, but it is assumed to be a property that represents the performance of the model on the dataset. 

    The query can be modified to include additional properties or to use different filters to select the models. 

    The query can also be modified to return a different type of output, such as a table or a graph.
