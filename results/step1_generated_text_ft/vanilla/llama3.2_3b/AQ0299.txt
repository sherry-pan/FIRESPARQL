Question:
What models are being evaluated on the Classic dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontology/orkg#>
     PREFIX dbo: <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/>
     PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
     SELECT?model?dataset 
     WHERE {
      ?model orkg:evaluatedOn?dataset.
       FILTER (str.contains(iri(?dataset), "Classic") &&!str.contains(iri(?dataset), "Test"))
     }
     ORDER BY (?model)
     LIMIT 1
    This query is using the following concepts:
    - The orkg:evaluatedOn predicate to represent the evaluation relationship between models and datasets.
    - The str.contains function to filter models that are being evaluated on the Classic dataset.
    - The! operator to exclude models being evaluated on the Test dataset.
    - The LIMIT 1 clause to return only the first matching model.
    - The ORDER BY clause to order the results alphabetically by model.
    Please note that the generated SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG.

    Note that the str.contains function may not work as expected if the dataset names are not exactly "Classic" but contain "Classic" as substring.

    To mitigate this issue, the! operator is used to exclude models being evaluated on the Test dataset.
