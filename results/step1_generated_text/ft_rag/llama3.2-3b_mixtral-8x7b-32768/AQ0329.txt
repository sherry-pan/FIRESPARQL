Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the BUCC French-to-English dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
        ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                         rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "BUCC French-to-English dataset")
        ?cont         orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
        ?eval         orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION    ?cont.
        ?paper       orkgp:P31               ?eval.
        ?model      orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?paper.
        ?model      rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
     }
