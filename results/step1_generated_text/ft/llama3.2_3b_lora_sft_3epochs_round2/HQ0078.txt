Question:
Where did the study with maximal geographic scale take place?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?location
     WHERE {
      ?papers rdf:type orkgc:Paper.
      ?papers rdfs:label?title.
       FILTER(REGEX(?title, "scale|geographic"))
      ?papers orkgp:P32?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P31?location.
       BIND(xsd:float(?location) AS?scale)
       ORDER BY DESC(?scale)
       LIMIT 1
     }<|eot_id|>
