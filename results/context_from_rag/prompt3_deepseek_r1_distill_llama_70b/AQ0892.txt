Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The main entities here are "evaluation metrics" and "Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std dataset". The property mentioned is "benchmarking models on".

Looking through the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a method with several steps, and R283709 and R283710 are about publications. However, I don't see any direct mention of evaluation metrics or the Habitat dataset.

Since the context doesn't have specific information about evaluation metrics or the Habitat dataset, I can't extract any relevant terms from it. Therefore, the candidates for each extracted term will be empty because there's no matching data in the provided context.

I should structure the JSON response as specified, grouping the results by the extracted terms and listing the candidates. Since there's no relevant data, each candidate list will be empty.

```json
{
  "question": "What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std dataset?",
  "extracted_terms": {
    "evaluation metrics",
    "Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std dataset",
    "benchmarking models on"
  },
  "candidates": {
    "evaluation metrics": [],
    "Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std dataset": [],
    "benchmarking models on": []
  }
}
```
