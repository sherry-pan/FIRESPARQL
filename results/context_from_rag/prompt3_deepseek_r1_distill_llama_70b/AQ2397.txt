Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the DeiT-Ti model for benchmarking purposes?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The key entities and properties mentioned are "DeiT-Ti model," "code references," "papers," and "benchmarking purposes." 

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates related to models, papers, and benchmarking. For example, R147652 describes a method involving models and datasets, and there are papers listed with authors and venues.

I need to find similar entities or properties. The DeiT-Ti model isn't explicitly mentioned, but there are models like "SVM" and datasets like "MNIST." Since DeiT-Ti is a specific model, I might look for related models or benchmarking steps. 

Next, I'll consider properties related to code references and benchmarking. The predicates like P39020 describe steps, which might include code usage. Also, papers have properties like HAS_VENUE and P27 for authors.

I'll structure the JSON output, grouping the extracted terms and their candidates. For each term, I'll list the top 5 relevant matches from the context, using the appropriate RDF prefixes and types.

I need to ensure that the URIs use the correct prefixes and that each candidate includes the necessary details like URI, label, and type. Since the exact model isn't present, I'll include related resources and predicates that might be relevant.

Finally, I'll format the JSON, making sure it's structured correctly for further processing, like generating SPARQL queries.
