Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of F1 metric on the BC5CDR-disease benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/> 
     PREFIX bc5cdr: <http://bc5cdr.org/ontology/> 
     SELECT?model?f1 
     WHERE {?model orkg:hasModel?modelBC5CDR  bc5cdr:hasF1?f1. FILTER (?f1 > 0.0 ) } 
     ORDER BY DESC (?f1 ) 
     LIMIT 1 
     ```
