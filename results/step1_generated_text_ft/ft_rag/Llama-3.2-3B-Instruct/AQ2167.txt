Question:
List the code links in papers that use the LSTM (Bai et al., 2018) model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
    SELECT?code_link
    WHERE {
     ?model       a            orkgc:Model;
                  rdfs:label      ?model_lbl.
      FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "LSTM (Bai et al., 2018)")
     ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
     ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
     ?cont          orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                     orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code_link.
    }
    ``` 

Note: The above SPARQL query is designed to work with the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) and assumes that the required data is available in the ORKG. The query is based on the provided context and the input question. The query retrieves code links in papers that use the LSTM model by Bai et al. (2018) in any benchmark. 

However, note that the query is not perfect, and you may need to adjust it according to the actual data and the ORKG's structure. Also, the query assumes that the model's label is exactly "LSTM (Bai et al., 2018)". If the actual label is different, you would need to adjust the query accordingly. 

Also, note that the query is case-sensitive. If you want to make the query case-insensitive, you can add `str(?model_lbl) = "LSTM (Bai et al., 2018)"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string` and `str(?cont_lbl) = "cont"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string` to the filter conditions. 

Finally, note that the query is not optimized for performance. If you need to query a large number of papers, you may need to optimize the query to reduce the number of joins and filter operations. 

Please consult the ORKG documentation for more information on how to optimize the query and use the SPARQL query language. 

Also, note that the SPARQL query is not the only way to answer the question. You may need to use other query languages or techniques, depending on the specific requirements of your use case. 

Please let me know if you need further assistance.
