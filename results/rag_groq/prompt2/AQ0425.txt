Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The user is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the WMT2016 German-English dataset. They want the papers along with their titles and IDs.

First, I'll look through the context information. The context has two main sections, each containing RDF data about research papers. Each paper has various properties like authors, venue, year, and a detailed description.

Looking at the first paper, R147246, it's from 2015 and authored by several researchers. The description isn't provided, so I can't tell if it's related to the WMT2016 dataset. The second paper, R284317, is from 2021 and authored by Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta. The description discusses entity knowledge extraction using NLP tools but doesn't mention the WMT2016 dataset.

Since neither paper explicitly mentions the WMT2016 German-English dataset, I can't confirm any benchmarks on it. Therefore, the candidates list will be empty because there's no relevant information in the context.
