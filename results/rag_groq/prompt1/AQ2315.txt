Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this question using the given context. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the A3C LSTM hs model and include links to their code. 

First, I look through the context provided. I see several resources listed, each with a URI, label, and sometimes types. I need to find papers, so I should focus on resources of type Paper. 

Looking at the context, I see entries like R211524, R211922, R211327, etc., all labeled as Papers. Their labels are titles of papers, but none of them mention A3C LSTM hs model. The context doesn't provide any information about specific models used in these papers or links to code. 

Since the context doesn't have any details about the A3C LSTM hs model or code links, I can't find any relevant papers from the given data. Therefore, the top similar entities based on the question are none because there's no matching information.

The given context does not contain any information related to the A3C LSTM hs model or links to code. Therefore, there are no similar entities or properties to retrieve.
