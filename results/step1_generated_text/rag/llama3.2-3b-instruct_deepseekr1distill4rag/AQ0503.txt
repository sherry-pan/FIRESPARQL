Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the BIOSSES dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?paperTitle?paperId
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasDatasetName "BIOSSES_dataset".
}
```    Note: You can use any other SPARQL syntax, but it should be valid and functional. The provided SPARQL query is just one possible solution.<|eot_id|>
