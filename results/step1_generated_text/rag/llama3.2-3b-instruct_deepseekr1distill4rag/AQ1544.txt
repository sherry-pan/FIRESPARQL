Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of F1 metric on the OntoNotes benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT?model?f1metric 
WHERE {
 ?model rdfs:label?modelLabel.
 ?f1metric rdfs:label "F1 metric".
  BIND(STR(?modelLabel) AS?model).
  BIND(STR("F1 metric") AS?f1metric).
 ?model a orkg:Model.
 ?f1metric a orkp:Property.
  SERVICE orkg:SPARQL {
    CONSTRUCT {
     ?model?f1metric.
    }
    WHERE {
     ?model a orkg:Model.
     ?f1metric a orkp:Property.
      BIND(STR(?modelLabel) AS?model).
      BIND(STR("F1 metric") AS?f1metric).
    }
  }
}
```

    Note: This SPARQL query is designed to work with the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) RDF data dump. The query is constructed based on the provided context and the extracted terms. It queries the ORKG to retrieve the model that performed best in terms of F1 metric on the OntoNotes benchmark dataset. The query returns the model and the F1 metric as variables. 

    This SPARQL query uses the `CONSTRUCT` clause to define the output variables, and the `SERVICE orkg:SPARQL` clause to execute the query on the ORKG. The query first binds the model and F1 metric labels to the `?model` and `?f1metric` variables, respectively. Then, it uses the `a` predicate to filter the results to only include models and properties. Finally, it uses the `CONSTRUCT` clause to construct the output variables. 

    The query assumes that the ORKG RDF data dump is available and that the necessary predicates and URIs are defined. The query may need to be modified to accommodate changes in the ORKG RDF data dump or to handle additional requirements. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to be executed on the ORKG, and the results will be returned in the format specified by the `CONSTRUCT` clause. 

    Note: This is a simplified example and may not cover all possible scenarios. In a real-world application, you would need to consider additional factors such as data quality, data normalization, and data security. 

    Also, the SPARQL query is case-sensitive and may not work correctly with non-ASCII characters.
