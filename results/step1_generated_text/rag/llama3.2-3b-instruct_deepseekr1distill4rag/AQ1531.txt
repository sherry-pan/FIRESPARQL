Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Test perplexity metric on the WikiText-103 benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?testPerplexity
WHERE {
 ?model rdfs:label?label.
 ?label rdfs:label "best model".
 ?model orkgp:hasEvaluation?evaluation.
 ?evaluation orkgp:hasMetric?testPerplexity.
 ?evaluation orkgp:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgc:hasName "WikiText-103".
 ?model rdfs:label?label.
  FILTER (?label = "BERT" ||?label = "RoBERTa" ||?label = "XLNet")
}
``` 
    Note: The actual SPARQL query might need adjustments based on the actual RDF data and the structure of the ORKG. The query above is based on the provided context and question. 

    The query is trying to find the model with the best Test perplexity on WikiText-103 by filtering the models that have a label indicating they are the "best model", have an evaluation that has a metric that is the Test perplexity, and have a dataset that is the WikiText-103 dataset. The query also filters the models to only include those that are BERT, RoBERTa, or XLNet. 

    However, please note that this query might not work as expected because the actual RDF data might not match the expected structure or the query might not be able to find the correct relationships between the entities. 

    To get a correct SPARQL query, you would need to analyze the actual RDF data and adjust the query accordingly. 

    Also, please note that the actual SPARQL query might need to be adjusted based on the actual RDF data and the structure of the ORKG. The query above is based on the provided context and question.
