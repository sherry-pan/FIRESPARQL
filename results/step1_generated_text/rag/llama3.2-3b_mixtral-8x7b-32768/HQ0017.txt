Question:
What is the most common location in the studies?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    SELECT?location
    WHERE {
   ?location a orkg:Location.
   ?location orkp:has_study?study.
   ?study orkp:has_contribution?contribution.
   ?contribution orkgp:has_location?location.
    GROUP BY?location
    HAVING (COUNT(?contribution) > 1)
    }
    ```
```sparql
    Note: This is not a complete SPARQL query, but rather a template for the query. You need to fill in the actual URIs and labels for the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    The query template is designed to filter out the contributions that do not have the same location. It groups the contributions by location and counts the number of contributions per location. It then filters out the locations that have only one contribution. 
    The actual SPARQL query will depend on the specific URIs and labels for the entities and properties mentioned in the question.
    You may need to add additional filters or transformations to the query to match the actual data in the ORKG.
``` Note. 
    I can help you fill in the actual URIs and labels for the entities and properties mentioned in the question if you want. 

    The SPARQL query can be filled in with the actual URIs and labels as follows:
    ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    SELECT?location
    WHERE {
   ?location a orkg:Location.
   ?location orkp:has_study?study.
   ?study orkp:has_contribution?contribution.
   ?contribution orkgp:has_location?location.
    GROUP BY?location
    HAVING (COUNT(?contribution) > 1)
    }
    ```
    If you want me to fill in the actual URIs and labels, please let me know which ones you would like me to use. 

    ORKG Entities and Properties:
    ORKG Entities:
    - orkg:Location
    - orkp:Study
    - orkp:Contribution
    - orkgp:has_location
    - orkgp:has_study
    ORKG Properties:
    - rdfs:label
    - rdf:type
    Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help you with. 

    To complete the query, we need to fill in the actual URIs
