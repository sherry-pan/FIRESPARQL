Question:
Which model has achieved the highest Score score on the Atari 2600 River Raid benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
     PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkg/>
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>

     SELECT?model?score
     WHERE {
      ?model orkgc:is_a orkgc:Model.
      ?model orkgc:has_score?score.
      ?score orkgp:HAS_VALUE "93.9".
      ?model orkgr:is_related_to orkgr:Atari_2600_River_Raid_benchmark_dataset.
     } 
     ORDER BY DESC(?score) 
     LIMIT 1 
    END; 

    Note: The provided input question, extracted terms, and candidates were used to generate the SPARQL query. The query is designed to query the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG) and retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 

    The SPARQL query starts by defining prefixes for the ORKG, then selects the model and score variables. The query then filters the models that have a score and are related to the Atari 2600 River Raid benchmark dataset. Finally, the query orders the results in descending order by score and limits the output to one result. 

    The output of the SPARQL query will be the model and its corresponding score. 

    Note: The actual values and URIs used in the SPARQL query are placeholders and may need to be replaced with the actual values from the ORKG. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the correct answer to the input question, which is the model that achieved the highest score on the Atari 2600 River Raid benchmark dataset. 

    The query is written in the standard SPARQL syntax and is designed to be executed on a SPARQL query engine. 

    The query uses the following predicates and resources:

    * orkgc:is_a (model is a type of model)
    * orkgc:has_score (model has a score)
    * orkgp:HAS_VALUE (score has a value)
    * orkgr:is_related_to (model is related to the dataset)
    * orkgr:Atari_2600_River_Raid_benchmark_dataset (dataset URI)
    * orkgc:Model (model class URI)
    * orkgp:Predicate (score property URI)
    * orkgc:Resource (dataset resource URI)
    * orkgc:Dataset (dataset type URI) 

    The query uses the following variables:

    *?model (model variable)
    *?score (score variable) 

    The query is designed to retrieve the correct answer to the input question, which is the model that achieved the highest score on the Atari 2600 River Raid benchmark dataset.

    * SELECT?model?score
    * WHERE {
    *  ?model orkgc:is_a orkgc:Model.
    *  ?model orkgc:has_score?score.
    *  ?score orkgp:HAS_VALUE "93.9".
    *  ?model orkgr:is_related_to orkgr:Atari_2600_River_Raid_benchmark_dataset.
    * }
    * ORDER BY DESC(?score) 
    * LIMIT 1 
    * END;
