Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given ORKG RDF data dump. The query is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the MLDoc Zero-Shot English-to-Russian dataset. The user wants the papers along with their titles and IDs.

First, I should look through the provided context to find any relevant entities. The context has several resources labeled as "Paper". For example, R211524 is a paper titled "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire". R211922 is another paper titled "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)". There's also R211327, which is a paper but without a specific title mentioned in the context. 

I need to check if any of these papers mention the MLDoc dataset. Looking through the context, I don't see any direct mention of "MLDoc" or "Zero-Shot English-to-Russian dataset". However, R211524 deals with named entity recognition, which might be related to machine translation tasks, but it's not explicitly stated. Similarly, R211922 focuses on neural modeling for named entities and morphology, which could be tangentially related but not a direct match.

Since the context doesn't provide explicit information about the MLDoc dataset, I have to infer based on the paper titles. None of the papers in the context seem to directly address benchmarks on the MLDoc Zero-Shot dataset. Therefore, the top similar entities based on the question's context would be the papers that are closest in topic, even if they don't exactly match the dataset mentioned.

So, I'll list the papers I found, even though they might not perfectly align with the query. Each entry will include the URI, label, and a score based on how relevant their topics are to the query. Since none directly mention the MLDoc dataset, their scores will be lower, but they are the closest matches available in the context.

To address the query about research papers benchmarking the MLDoc Zero-Shot English-to-Russian dataset, I reviewed the provided ORKG data. While none of the papers explicitly mention the MLDoc dataset, the following are the closest matches based on their topics:

1. **NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire**  
   - URI: http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524  
   - Score: 0.65

2. **Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)**  
   - URI: http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211922  
   - Score: 0.58

3. **Component for template R206311**  
   - URI: http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211319  
   - Score: 0.45

4. **Paper R211327**  
   - URI: http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211327  
   - Score: 0.42

5. **BabelEnconding**  
   - URI: http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R76234  
   - Score: 0.38

These papers were selected for their relevance to named entity recognition and neural modeling, which are related to machine translation tasks, though not specifically the MLDoc dataset.
