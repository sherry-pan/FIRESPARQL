Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Where can I find code references in papers that have used the EfficientNetV2-L model for benchmarking purposes?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The main entities here are "EfficientNetV2-L model" and "benchmarking purposes." The action is about finding "code references in papers," so the properties involved would relate to where these references are located or how they're connected.

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a method with steps involving NER and CRF algorithms. R284316 talks about a journal article on extracting entity knowledge using models like Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight. There's also information about venues, years, and authors.

I need to find entities related to the EfficientNetV2-L model. In the context, I don't see it explicitly mentioned, but there are mentions of models like SVM and MNIST, which are related to machine learning. Since EfficientNetV2-L is a model, I can infer that it might be categorized under similar types.

Next, for benchmarking purposes, I look for terms related to evaluation or performance. The context has terms like "validation research" and "evaluation." There's a resource R284316 that's a journal article about model evaluation, which might be relevant.

Regarding code references in papers, I need to find properties or entities that link papers to their code. In the context, there's a URL predicate (P26) with a DOI link, which could be a way to access the paper and potentially its code.

I'll extract the terms: "EfficientNetV2-L model," "benchmarking purposes," and "code references in papers." Now, I'll compute similarity scores. Since the context doesn't have EfficientNetV2-L, I'll look for similar models. SVM and MNIST are mentioned, so they might be candidates. For benchmarking, terms like "validation research" and "evaluation" are relevant. For code references, the URL and DOI properties are important.

I'll structure the JSON output with these extracted terms and their top candidates based on similarity. Each candidate will have a URI, label, score, type, and RDF type as per the guidelines.
