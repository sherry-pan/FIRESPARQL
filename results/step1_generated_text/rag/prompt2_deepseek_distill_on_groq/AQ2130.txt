Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The query is asking for a list of papers that used the Large mLSTM model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information. The context has two main sections from the ORKG RDF dump. 

Looking at the first section, I see that resource R147652 describes a research method with five steps. It mentions using SciBERT and a CRF algorithm. There's also some information about authors and a venue, but nothing about the mLSTM model or code links.

The second section is about resource R284316, which is a journal article titled "validation research" and uses techniques like Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight. It also mentions datasets like AIDA and MEANTIME. The authors here are Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta, and there's a DOI link provided. 

I don't see any mention of the Large mLSTM model in either section. The models mentioned are SVM, CRF, Stanford NER, Flair NER, etc., but not mLSTM. Also, there are no specific links to code provided in the context.

Since the context doesn't contain information about the Large mLSTM model or code links, I can't extract any relevant papers from it. Therefore, the candidates list will be empty for both the model and code links.

I need to structure the JSON response as per the example, extracting the terms and listing the candidates. Since there's no relevant data, the candidates will be empty arrays.
