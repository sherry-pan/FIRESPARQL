Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the DeiT-Ti model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
      ?paper a orkgc:Paper;
         rdfs:label?title.
       FILTER(REGEX(?title, "DeiT-Ti"))
      ?paper orkgp:P31?cont.
      ?cont orkgp:P43046?code.<|eot_id|>
