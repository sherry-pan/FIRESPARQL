Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of F1 metric on the ShARe/CLEF eHealth corpus benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
```

    SELECT?model?metric?dataset
    WHERE {
       ?model rdfs:label "performed best".
       ?metric rdfs:label "F1 metric".
       ?dataset rdfs:label "ShARe/CLEF eHealth corpus benchmark dataset".
       ?model orkgp:has_best_model?metric.
       ?metric orkgp:is_metric_for?dataset.
        BIND (filter(strContains(lcase(?model), 'bio')) AS?model)
    }
    ```


    This SPARQL query is designed to find the model that performed best in terms of F1 metric on the ShARe/CLEF eHealth corpus benchmark dataset. The query is based on the provided context, which includes candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question. The query uses the following variables:

   ?model: The model that performed best.
   ?metric: The F1 metric.
   ?dataset: The ShARe/CLEF eHealth corpus benchmark dataset.

    The query first filters the models to find the one that has the best model for the F1 metric. Then, it filters the F1 metrics to find the one that is used for the ShARe/CLEF eHealth corpus benchmark dataset. Finally, it uses a filter to select only the models that contain the string "Bio" in their labels (case-insensitive). The query returns the selected model, metric, and dataset.<|eot_id|>
