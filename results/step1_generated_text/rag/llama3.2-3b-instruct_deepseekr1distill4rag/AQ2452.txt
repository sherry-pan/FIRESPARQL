Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the AxCell model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc/>
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>

    SELECT?paper?model?code_reference
    WHERE {
     ?paper a orkgc:Publication.
     ?paper orkgr:has_code_reference?code_reference.
     ?paper orkgr:has_model?model.
     ?model orkgr:has_benchmarking_purpose?benchmarking_purpose.
     ?benchmarking_purpose a orkgc:Purpose.
     ?benchmarking_purpose orkgr:has_benchmarking_purpose_for?paper.
     ?model orkgr:has_benchmarking_purpose_for?paper.
    }
    ``` 
    Given the context provided, the SPARQL query is designed to find papers that have used the SVM model for benchmarking purposes, and have code references. The query joins the `Publication` and `Model` resources to find papers that have used the SVM model, and then joins the `Publication` and `Code Reference` resources to find papers that have code references. The `Benchmarking Purpose` resource is used to filter papers that have used the SVM model for benchmarking purposes. The query is designed to be executed on the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Please note that the URIs in the SPARQL query are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual URIs of the resources in the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Also, please note that this query is a simplified version and might not cover all the cases. It's recommended to add more filters and join conditions based on the actual data in the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    This query is designed to be executed on a triplestore or a SPARQL endpoint that supports the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    The query is also designed to be executed in a batch mode, where the input question and context are provided as input to the query, and the output is generated based on the query results. 

    The output of this query is a list of papers that have used the SVM model for benchmarking purposes, and have code references. The output can be further filtered and processed based on the specific requirements of the application. 

    The query can be executed using a SPARQL client or a SPARQL endpoint that supports the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    The output of this query can be used to generate a list of papers that have used the SVM model for benchmarking purposes, and have code references. The output can be further processed and analyzed to extract relevant information.
