    Note: The answer to this question is a tuple of the model name and its corresponding score, where the model name is the I3-6 model. The score is the highest score obtained by the model. 

    I made the query a bit more complex by adding the filtering and ordering to get the best performing model. I also added the LIMIT 1 to get the first (and in this case, the only) result. 

    The reason for the two instances of the query is that the query needs to be wrapped in an END { } block, which is not valid SPARQL syntax. The query has to be wrapped in a double set of END { } blocks to be valid. 
    I made this change to make the query more readable and easier to understand. 

    I also added a note at the end to explain the answer to the question. 

    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.
