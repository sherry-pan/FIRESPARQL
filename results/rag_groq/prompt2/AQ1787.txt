Okay, I need to figure out which model achieved the highest score on the Atari 2600 Yars Revenge dataset. Let me start by breaking down the question. The key terms here are "model" and "Atari 2600 Yars Revenge dataset." 

Looking at the provided context, I see several resources. The first part talks about a method involving steps like seed terms, expansion, and named entity recognition. It mentions using SciBERT and k-means, which are related to NLP tasks. The second part describes a research article about extracting entity knowledge from text using a model called jpark. It also mentions datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP, but not Atari.

I don't see any direct mention of Atari 2600 Yars Revenge in the context. The models discussed are more about NER and entity linking, not game playing. The context includes metrics like F1 score and mentions of performance, but again, not in the context of Atari games.

Since the context doesn't provide information about Atari 2600 Yars Revenge or models evaluated on it, I can't extract relevant terms or compute similarity scores. Therefore, there are no candidates to list in the answer.
