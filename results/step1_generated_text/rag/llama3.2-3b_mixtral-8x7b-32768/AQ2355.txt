Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
SELECT?paper?code
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:Paper.
 ?paper ora:HAS_PAPER?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:HAS_CODE?code.
 ?paper ora:hasTitle?title.
 ?paper ora:hasAuthor?author.
 ?paper ora:hasURL?url.
 ?code ora:hasCode?code.
 ?code ora:hasTitle?title.
 ?code ora:hasAuthor?author.
 ?code ora:hasURL?url.
  FILTER (STR(?title) = "BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model")
  FILTER (STR(?url) = "https://www.example.com/bilstm-attention-elmo-model")
}
```
    The final answer to the question "Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model?" is the set of papers that benchmark the BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model and provide a link to the code. The papers are linked by their title and URL, and the code is linked by its title, author, and URL. 

    The query is designed to retrieve the correct answer to the input question by filtering the papers based on the title and URL of the BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model. The query is also designed to retrieve the correct answer by linking the papers and code based on their titles, authors, and URLs. 

    The query uses the following predicates:
    - ora:Paper: A class for representing papers.
    - ora:hasTitle: A predicate for representing the title of a paper.
    - ora:hasAuthor: A predicate for representing the author of a paper.
    - ora:hasURL: A predicate for representing the URL of a paper.
    - ora:hasCode: A predicate for representing the code of a paper.
    - ora:Code: A class for representing code.
    - ora:hasCode: A predicate for representing the code of a code.
    - ora:hasTitle: A predicate for representing the title of a code.
    - ora:hasAuthor: A predicate for representing the author of a code.
    - ora:hasURL: A predicate for representing the URL of a code.
    - ora:R123456: A unique identifier for the BiLSTM-Attention + ELMo model.
    - ora:Benchmark: A class for representing benchmarks.
    - ora:hasBenchmark: A predicate for representing the benchmark of a paper.
