Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the BERTwwm + SQuAD 2 model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
    SELECT?paper?code
    WHERE {
     ?paper orkgp:used_in_papers?model.
     ?model orkgr:label "BERTwwm + SQuAD 2 model"@en.
     ?paper orkgp:benchmark?benchmark.
     ?benchmark orkgp:property "http://example.org/code_links"@en.
     ?benchmark orkgp:property?code.
    }
    ``` 
    The final answer is not a number but a SPARQL query that can be executed on the ORKG. 

    Note: The provided context and question are used to demonstrate the process of generating a SPARQL query. The actual SPARQL query may vary depending on the specific requirements and the structure of the ORKG. 

    Please note that the output is a SPARQL query and not a numerical answer. The format of the answer is specified in the prompt. 

    If you need any further assistance or clarification, please let me know. 

    The final answer is $\boxed{SPARQL Query}$.
