Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the Pointer + Coverage + EntailmentGen + QuestionGen model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?resource
WHERE {
 ?model    a            orkgc:Model;
            rdfs:label   ?model_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "Pointer + Coverage + EntailmentGen + QuestionGen")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                  orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?source_code.
 ?source_code    rdfs:label               ?code_lbl.
 ?resource      orkgp:P31               ?cont.
}
