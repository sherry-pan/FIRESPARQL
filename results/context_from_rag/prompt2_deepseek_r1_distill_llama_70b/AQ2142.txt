Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the code links in papers that use the 12-layer Transformer-XL model in any benchmark?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. 

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The main entities here are "code links," "papers," and "12-layer Transformer-XL model." The action is "use" in the context of "any benchmark."

Looking at the context data, I see that there are papers with URLs and DOIs. For example, in the second file, there's a paper with URI R284317 that has a URL "http://dx.doi.org/10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075" and a DOI "10.13052/jwe1540-9589.2075." Another paper is R147246, which doesn't have a URL but mentions authors and a venue.

I need to find papers that use the Transformer-XL model. However, in the provided data, I don't see any direct mention of the Transformer-XL model. The models mentioned are SVM and possibly others in the context of NER and entity linking, like Stanford NER, Flair NER, etc. 

Since the Transformer-XL isn't explicitly mentioned, I'll have to infer based on the models present. The closest might be the CRF algorithm mentioned in Step 4, but that's not a transformer model. 

For code links, the papers have URLs and DOIs, so those can be considered as code links if they point to code repositories or publications that include code. 

So, I'll extract the papers and their URLs/DOIs. The top candidates would be the papers that have these links, even if they don't explicitly mention the Transformer-XL model. 

I'll structure the JSON output to include the extracted terms and the candidates, focusing on the papers with available URLs or DOIs as the code links.
