Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The user is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the MMV TSM-50x2 model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of the MMV TSM-50x2 model. Scanning the context, I see that the model isn't explicitly mentioned. The context includes information about other models like SVM and mentions of datasets like MNIST, but nothing about MMV TSM-50x2.

Next, I check if there are any papers or resources linked to models in the context. The context includes two papers: one from 2015 with authors Ligia Sierra, Betty L LÃ³pez, Flavio Forni, Maria Angela Vandelli, Michele Zoli, and Antonietta Vilella, and another from 2021 by Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta. However, neither of these papers mentions the MMV TSM-50x2 model.

Since the model isn't present in the context, I can't retrieve any relevant papers or code links. Therefore, the answer should indicate that no relevant information was found in the provided data.

Based on the provided context, there is no information about the MMV TSM-50x2 model or any associated papers and code links. The context discusses other models and datasets but does not include the specific model mentioned in the query.
