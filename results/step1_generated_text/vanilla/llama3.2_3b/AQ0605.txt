Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the Atari 2600 Skiing dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>

    Note: 
     - The ORKG has the following properties:
     - `orkg:paper`: represents a research paper
     - `orkg:paperId`: a unique identifier for a research paper
     - `orkg:title`: the title of a research paper
     - `orkg:id`: the unique identifier of a research paper
     - `orkg:benchmarkedOn`: a relation between a research paper and a benchmarking target
     - `orkg:targetDataset`: a relation between a research paper and a benchmarking target
     - `orkg:datasetName`: a relation between a benchmarking target and a dataset name
     - `skos:prefLabel`: the preferred label of a resource
     - `skos:broader`: a relation between a resource and a broader term
    - The ORKG has the following dataset:
    - `Atari 2600 Skiing` is a benchmarking target
    - `Atari 2600 Skiing` is a dataset name
    - `Atari 2600 Skiing` is a resource that has the preferred label "Atari 2600 Skiing"@en

    ```python
def get_orkg_query(question):
    # Your code here
    pass
```
    You can use the following code to generate the SPARQL query:
    ```python
def get_orkg_query(question):
    # Tokenize the question
    tokens = question.split()

    # Get the main topic (e.g., "research paper")
    main_topic = tokens[0]

    # Get the specific topic (e.g., "Atari 2600 Skiing")
    specific_topic = tokens[2]

    # Define the SPARQL query
    sparql_query = (
        "PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>"
        "PREFIX skos: <http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#>"
        "SELECT?title?id "
        "WHERE {?paper?paperId."
        " <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/#benchmarkedOn>?benchmarkingRel."
        "?benchmarkingRel?benchmarkingTarget."
        " <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/#targetDataset>?benchmarkingTarget."
        " <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/#datasetName>?benchmarkingTarget."
