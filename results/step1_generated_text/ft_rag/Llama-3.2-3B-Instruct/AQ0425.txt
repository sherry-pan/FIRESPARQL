Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the WMT2016 German-English dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WMT2016 German-English")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
      ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                      rdfs:label          ?paper_lbl.
     }```

The final answer is: 
SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                 rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "WMT2016 German-English")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                rdfs:label          ?paper_lbl.
}```
