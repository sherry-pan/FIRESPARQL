Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to answer the question using the provided JSON context. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the C51 noop model and include links to their code. 

First, I need to identify the relevant properties from the JSON that can help answer this. The JSON contains various properties related to ORKG, such as methods, datasets, evaluations, etc.

I'll start by looking for properties that relate to methods or approaches since the question is about a specific model (C51 noop). The property "method" with label "method" seems relevant because it can help identify which papers used a particular method.

Next, to find papers, I might need properties related to publications or implementations. The property "implementation" with label "implementation" could link to where the model is implemented, possibly leading to code or papers.

The question also asks for links to code, so a property that indicates where code is stored would be useful. "has implementation" might be too generic, but it could still point to repositories or codebases.

Additionally, "evaluation" could be relevant because papers often include evaluations of their methods, which might mention the C51 noop model.

I should also consider if there are properties that directly link to papers or publications, but looking through the JSON, I don't see a direct "publication" property. So, I'll have to rely on the ones that can indirectly point to papers through methods and implementations.

Putting it all together, the most relevant properties are "method", "implementation", "has implementation", and "evaluation". These can help track down which papers used the C51 noop model and where their code is located.
