Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the STS Benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "STS Benchmark")
        ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
        ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
        ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont.
        ?paper         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
