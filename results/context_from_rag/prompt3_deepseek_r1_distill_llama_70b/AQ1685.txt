Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What is the name of the model with the highest ROUGE-2 score when benchmarked on the CL-SciSumm dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data.

First, I'll break down the question to extract the relevant terms. The key entities here are "model" and "CL-SciSumm dataset". The property mentioned is "ROUGE-2 score" and the action is "benchmark".

Looking at the context data, I see several resources and predicates. For example, R147246 has multiple authors and is associated with a value of 93.9, which might be a score. R283709 and R283710 are about papers and have various predicates like P31, HAS_VENUE, P29, etc.

I need to find entities related to models and datasets. The term "model" could correspond to resources like R147246 or R283710. The dataset "CL-SciSumm" isn't explicitly mentioned, but maybe it's related to some resource through predicates.

Next, I'll look for properties that indicate benchmarking or evaluation. Predicates like P39020 describe steps, but I'm not sure if they relate to ROUGE-2. The HAS_VALUE predicate in R147244 has a value of 93.9, which might be a score.

I'll check if any resources are linked to ROUGE-2. Since it's not directly mentioned, I might infer based on high scores. R147244 has a high value, so maybe that's the top model.

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and the top candidates. For "model", I'll include R147246 and R283710. For "CL-SciSumm dataset", I'll look for any related resources, but since it's not present, I might leave it empty or note that it's not found. Similarly, for "ROUGE-2 score", I'll include the HAS_VALUE predicate.

I need to ensure the URIs use the correct prefixes and include the rdf:type for each candidate. I'll make sure the JSON follows the specified format, grouping the results under each extracted term.
