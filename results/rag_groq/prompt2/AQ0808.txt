Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the SQuAD1.1 dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the ORKG data is in Turtle format, and I have two files here. I need to extract relevant terms from the question. The question is about metrics used to evaluate models on the SQuAD1.1 dataset. So, the key entities here are "SQuAD1.1 dataset" and "metrics". The properties would relate to evaluation, like "evaluated on" or "used to evaluate".

Looking at the context information, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, in the first file, there's R147244 with a value of 93.9, which might be a metric. Then there's R147246 with various authors and publication details. The second file has R284316, which is a journal article about extracting entity knowledge from text, using metrics like F1-score and accuracy.

I need to extract the terms "SQuAD1.1 dataset" and "metrics". Wait, but in the context, I don't see SQuAD1.1 mentioned. Hmm, maybe it's not directly there. So perhaps I need to look for related datasets or metrics used in similar contexts.

Looking at the first file, R147244 has a value of 93.9, which could be an F1-score or accuracy. R147246 is a publication with authors and venue, so maybe the metrics used in that paper are relevant. The second file, R284316, talks about evaluation using F1-score and other metrics, and it's published in Italy in 2021.

So, the metrics mentioned in these resources could be F1-score, accuracy, precision, recall, etc. Since the question is about SQuAD1.1, which is a question answering dataset, the metrics used are likely F1-score and accuracy, as these are common for such tasks.

Now, I need to compute similarity scores for these terms. Since SQuAD1.1 isn't directly in the data, I'll have to infer based on similar datasets. The context mentions "ACL Anthology dataset" and "NLP Benchmark Dataset", which might be similar. So, the similarity scores for these would be high.

For metrics, terms like "F1-score", "accuracy", etc., would have high similarity. I'll list the top 5 metrics based on their relevance and the context provided.

Putting it all together, I'll structure the JSON with the extracted terms and the top candidates, ensuring the URIs use the correct prefixes and include the necessary types.
