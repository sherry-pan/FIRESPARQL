Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the BIOSSES dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl?paper_id
     WHERE {
      ?dataset        a                orkgc:Dataset;
                       rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "BIOSSES")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
      ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                       rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
      ?paper         orkgc:ID               ?paper_id.
     }<|eot_id|>
