Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the Atari 2600 Asterix dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology#>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology#>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology#>
    SELECT?title?id
    WHERE {
       ?paper orkgc:contributesTo orkg:R131168.
       ?paper orkggp:HAS_TITLE?title.
       ?paper orkggp:HAS_ID?id.
    }
    ``` 
    If you want to generate more complex queries, please let me know. 

## Step 1: Identify the relevant entities and properties from the context.
The context provides the following entities and properties:
- Entities: "research papers", "Atari 2600 Asterix dataset", "benchmark"
- Properties: "titles", "IDs", "benchmark"

## Step 2: Determine the relationships between the entities and properties.
From the context, we can infer the following relationships:
- Research papers contribute to the Atari 2600 Asterix dataset.
- Research papers have titles and IDs.
- The Atari 2600 Asterix dataset has a benchmark.
- Research papers can have a benchmark.

## Step 3: Generate the SPARQL query based on the relationships.
The SPARQL query should filter research papers that contribute to the Atari 2600 Asterix dataset and have a benchmark. We can use the following query:
```
SELECT?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgc:contributesTo orkg:R131168.
 ?paper orkggp:HAS_TITLE?title.
 ?paper orkggp:HAS_ID?id.
}
```
This query selects the titles and IDs of research papers that contribute to the Atari 2600 Asterix dataset.

## Step 4: Refine the query to only include research papers with a benchmark for the Atari 2600 Asterix dataset.
We need to add a filter to only include research papers that have a benchmark for the Atari 2600 Asterix dataset. We can use the following query:
```
SELECT?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper orkgc
