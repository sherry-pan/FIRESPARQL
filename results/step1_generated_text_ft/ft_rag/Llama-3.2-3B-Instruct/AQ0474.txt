Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the RotoWire (Relation Generation) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "RotoWire (Relation Generation)")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
      ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?benchmark;
                      rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
     }      ```<|eot_id|>
