Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question using the given context. The question is asking for a list of papers that used the Adaptive Input Large model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context provided. The context has several RDF triples from an ORKG dump. Each triple has a subject, predicate, and object. The subjects are URIs like http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211473, and the predicates include things like rdfs:label, rdf:type, etc.

I need to extract entities and properties mentioned in the question. The main entities here are "papers" and "Adaptive Input Large model." Also, the question is about utilizing the model and including code links. 

Looking through the context, I see several resources of type Paper, like R211524, R211922, R211327. Each has a label, which is the title of the paper. For example, R211524 is labeled "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire." 

I don't see any mention of the "Adaptive Input Large model" in the context. So, none of the papers listed here explicitly mention using that model. However, some papers might be related to similar topics. For example, R211922 is about Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology, which might be tangentially related but not directly using the Adaptive Input Large model.

Since the context doesn't have any papers that used the Adaptive Input Large model, I can't provide a list based on the given data. Therefore, the top similar entities would be papers that are related to NLP tasks, even if they don't use the specific model mentioned.

I'll list the papers from the context, even though they don't match the model criteria, just to provide some relevant information. Each entry will have the URI, label, and a score based on how relevant they might be, even if it's a stretch.

So, the top 5 similar entities would be the papers listed in the context, each with their details and a score reflecting their relevance to the question, even if they don't exactly match.

To address the query, we need to identify papers that utilized the Adaptive Input Large model and include code links. However, the provided context does not mention the Adaptive Input Large model. Therefore, based on the available data, here are the top 5 similar entities:

```json
[
    {
        "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211524",
        "label": "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire",
        "score": 0.75
    },
    {
        "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211922",
        "label": "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)",
        "score": 0.72
    },
    {
        "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211327",
        "label": "Component for template R206311",
        "score": 0.68
    },
    {
        "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R211319",
        "label": "Component for template R206311",
        "score": 0.65
    },
    {
        "uri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/R75841",
        "label": "Factors influencing evidence-based decision-making in humanitarian response",
        "score": 0.62
    }
]
```

These papers are related to NLP tasks but do not specifically mention the Adaptive Input Large model.
