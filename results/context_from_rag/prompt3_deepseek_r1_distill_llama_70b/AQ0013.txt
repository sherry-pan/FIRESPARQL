Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the CommonsenseQA dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "models" and "CommonsenseQA dataset". The property mentioned is "evaluated on". So, I need to look for these terms in the RDF data.

Looking at the context information, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there's a resource R147652 which has steps involving models and datasets. It mentions using a CRF algorithm, which might be a model. Also, there are other resources like R147244, R147246, and R283709 which have various properties and values.

I need to find entities similar to "models" and "CommonsenseQA dataset". In the RDF data, I see mentions of "SVM" and "MNIST" as seed terms, which are models and datasets respectively. There's also a mention of "SciBERT" used for semantic relatedness. These could be related to the models in question.

For the property "evaluated on", I look for predicates that describe evaluation. The RDF data has predicates like P39020, which describes steps involving evaluation and annotation. There's also P5044, P41924, etc., but I'm not sure if they directly relate to evaluation.

I should extract the terms "models", "CommonsenseQA dataset", and "evaluated on". Then, find the top 5 similar entities or properties for each. 

Looking through the data, I find resources like R147652, which is about a method involving models and datasets. R283709 mentions "method" and "solution proposal", which could relate to models. R283710 has authors, which might not be directly relevant but could be part of the context.

I also notice that some resources are connected via predicates like P27, which lists authors, and P31, which indicates types. These might help in identifying the correct entities.

Now, I'll structure the JSON output as per the example. I'll group the results by the extracted terms and include the URIs with their labels and types.

I need to make sure to use the correct RDF prefixes: "orkgr:" for resources, "orkgp:" for properties, etc. Also, include the rdf:type information for each candidate.

After going through the data, I'll list the top 5 candidates for each extracted term, ensuring they are relevant and properly formatted.
