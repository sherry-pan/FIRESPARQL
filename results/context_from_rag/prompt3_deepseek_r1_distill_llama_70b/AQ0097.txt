Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the Multimodal PISA dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "models" and "Multimodal PISA dataset". The property mentioned is "evaluated on". So, I need to look for these in the context.

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 has steps involving models and datasets like SVM and MNIST. There's also information about CRF algorithms and named entity recognition. Another resource, R283709, talks about keyphrase extraction, named entity recognition, and graph analytics. It mentions "method" and "solution proposal" as predicates.

I need to find entities similar to "models" and "Multimodal PISA dataset". In the context, I see mentions of "models" in the steps, like SVM. For datasets, there's MNIST mentioned. There's also a resource R283709 that's a journal article about methods and solutions, which might relate to models.

The property "evaluated on" would correspond to a predicate that links models to datasets. In the context, I see predicates like P39020, which describes steps, and P27, which lists authors. There's also P5044 indicating the type is a journal article, and P41924 for scholarly domain. However, I don't see a direct predicate for "evaluated on". Maybe P97003 (entity extraction) or P97004 (solution proposal) could be related.

Now, I'll try to map these. For "models", the closest matches are resources like R147652, which mentions SVM and MNIST. For "Multimodal PISA dataset", since it's not directly mentioned, I'll look for similar datasets like MNIST or any that are part of the context. The predicates related to evaluation might be P97005 (method) or P5044 (journal article).

Putting this together, I'll structure the JSON with the extracted terms and their candidates. Each candidate will have a URI with the appropriate prefix, a label, and type. Since the exact dataset isn't present, I'll include the closest matches and relevant predicates.

I need to ensure that the URIs use the correct prefixes: orkgr: for resources, orkgp: for predicates, etc. Also, include the rdf:type information for each candidate.

Finally, I'll format the JSON as specified, grouping the results under each extracted term and including up to five candidates each, even if some are placeholders due to missing data.
