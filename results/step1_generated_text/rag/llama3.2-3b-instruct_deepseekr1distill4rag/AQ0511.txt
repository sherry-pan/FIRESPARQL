Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the STS Benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?title?id WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset ora:label?datasetLabel.
  FILTER (str(?datasetLabel) = "STS Benchmark dataset"^^xsd:string).
  SERVICE orkgr:repo {
   ?paper ora:title?title.
   ?paper ora:id?id.
  }
}
```    Note: The provided context is not fully available, but the relevant part is shown. The actual context would be required to provide a correct SPARQL query. 

    The final answer is:

    ```sparql
SELECT?paper?title?id WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset ora:label?datasetLabel.
  FILTER (str(?datasetLabel) = "STS Benchmark dataset"^^xsd:string).
  SERVICE orkgr:repo {
   ?paper ora:title?title.
   ?paper ora:id?id.
  }
}
```<|eot_id|>
