Question:
Could you provide a list of models that have been tested on the NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only) benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only)")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
      ?paper         orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
       OPTIONAL {?paper      orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model.
               ?model      rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.}
     }
```

    This SPARQL query will return all models tested on the NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only) benchmark dataset. If there are no models, it will return an empty result set. The query works as follows:

1.  It starts by selecting the model and its label (`?model?model_lbl`).
2.  The `WHERE` clause is used to define the query.
3.  The first part of the `WHERE` clause filters the dataset labels to only include "NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only)".
4.  The next part of the `WHERE` clause establishes the relationship between the dataset and the benchmark.
5.  The following part of the `WHERE` clause establishes the relationship between the benchmark and the paper.
6.  The `OPTIONAL` part of the `WHERE` clause is used to handle cases where a paper may or may not have a model associated with it. If a paper has a model, its label is selected; otherwise, `?model_lbl` is assigned the value `xsd:string` to indicate that there is no model associated with the paper.
7.  The query will return the model and its label if a model is found for the NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only) benchmark dataset. If no models are found, it will return an empty result set.<|eot_id|>
