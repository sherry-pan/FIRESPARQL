Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The question is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the Table-Sequence model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context information. I see two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 seems to describe a method involving steps like seed terms, expansion, annotation, NER, and filtering. R284316 talks about a journal article titled "validation research" and mentions techniques like named entity recognition and linking. 

I need to extract relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "Table-Sequence model" and "papers." The properties would be "utilized" and "links to their code." 

Looking at the context, I don't see any direct mention of the Table-Sequence model. However, R284316 discusses NER and entity linking, which might relate to models used in papers. 

Since there's no explicit mention of the Table-Sequence model, I can't find exact matches. But I can look for papers that discuss models or techniques related to NER, as that's a common area. 

R284316 is a journal article from 2021, so it's a candidate. It has a DOI link, which could be where the code is hosted. 

I'll structure the answer to include this paper as a candidate, noting the similarity based on the discussion of NER models. 

I also need to make sure the JSON format is correct, using the right prefixes and including all necessary fields like URI, label, score, type, and rdf:type.
