Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the FG fine-grained gate model?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
     ?paper orkgp:P31 [
           orkgp:P32?model
       ];
       rdfs:label?title.
       FILTER(REGEX(?title, "FG fine-grained gate"))
      ?benchmark orkgp:P5008?paper.
      ?cont?properties?code.
      ?properties orkgp:P5009?benchmark.
     }<|eot_id|>
