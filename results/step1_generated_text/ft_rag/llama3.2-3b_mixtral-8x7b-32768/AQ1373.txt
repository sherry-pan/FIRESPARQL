Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Sequence error metric on the FSNS - Test benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
     SELECT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
       orkgp:R122689 orkgc:rs123456 orkgp:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
      ?dataset orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION?eval.
      ?eval orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
      ?metric rdfs:label?metric_lbl.
      ?metric orkgp:HAS_VALUE?value.
       BIND(xsd:float(?value) AS?value).
      ?value orkgp:HAS_MODEL?model.
      ?model rdfs:label?model_lbl.
       FILTER(REGEX(STR(?metric_lbl), "Sequence error", "i"))
       FILTER(REGEX(STR(?value), "[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?", "i"))
     }
     ```
    If you want to get the best model, you need to add a FILTER to get the minimum value of the sequence error metric. You can do this by adding the following line:
       FILTER(REGEX(STR(?metric_lbl), "Sequence error", "i"))
       FILTER(REGEX(STR(?value), "[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?", "i"))
       ORDER BY DESC(?value)
       LIMIT 1```

    This SPARQL query is designed to find the model that performed best in terms of the Sequence error metric on the FSNS - Test benchmark dataset. It first filters the evaluations to only include those with the Sequence error metric, and then filters the metrics to only include those with a numeric value. It then orders the results by the value of the sequence error metric in descending order, and finally limits the results to the top one. 

    The SPARQL query is written in the ORKG query language and uses the provided context to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG. 

    The query first binds the value of the sequence error metric to a float, and then uses this value in the filtering and ordering steps. 

    The query assumes that the model and metric labels are not needed for the final answer, and therefore only binds the model label to the variable?model_lbl. 

    The query uses the `FILTER` function to apply the regular expression filters, and the `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT` clauses to order and limit the results. 

    The `REGEX` function is used to match the sequence error metric label and the numeric value of the sequence error metric. 

    The `STR` function is used to convert the labels and values to strings, which is necessary for the regular expression matching. 

    The `xsd:float` data type is used to represent the numeric value of the sequence error metric. 

    The `R122689` URI is used to identify the FSNS - Test benchmark dataset. 

    The `HAS_DATASET` and `HAS_EVALUATION` properties are used to link the dataset and evaluation to the rest of the graph. 

    The `HAS_METRIC` and `HAS
