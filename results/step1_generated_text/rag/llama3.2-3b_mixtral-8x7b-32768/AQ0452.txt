Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the PubMedQA dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/>
PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/Resource/>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearchknowledgegraph.org/ontology/Property/>

SELECT?paper?paperTitle?paperId
WHERE {
 ?paper orkg:hasDataset orkgc:Resource?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgc:label "PubMedQA"@en.
 ?paper orkgp:hasPaper?paperPaper.
 ?paperPaper orkgp:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgp:hasDataset?datasetBenchmark.
 ?datasetBenchmark orkgp:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?paper orkgp:hasTitle?paperTitle.
 ?paper orkgp:hasId?paperId.
}
```

    Note: The SPARQL query uses the `ORKG` prefix to access the Open Research Knowledge Graph's data. The `ORKG` prefix is used to denote the `hasDataset` property, `ORKGC` prefix is used to denote the `hasDataset` property of resources, `ORKGP` prefix is used to denote the `hasDataset` property of papers. Similarly, other properties are denoted using their respective prefixes. 

    The `ORKG` prefix is used to denote the `hasDataset` property, `ORKGC` prefix is used to denote the `hasDataset` property of resources, `ORKGP` prefix is used to denote the `hasDataset` property of papers. Similarly, other properties are denoted using their respective prefixes. 

    This SPARQL query assumes that the `hasDataset` property is used to link research papers to the PubMedQA dataset, and the `hasBenchmark` property is used to link research papers to benchmarks. The `hasTitle` and `hasId` properties are used to link research papers to their titles and IDs, respectively. 

    The query first filters the research papers that include a benchmark for the PubMedQA dataset by linking them to the PubMedQA dataset using the `hasDataset` property, and then filters the papers to get the ones that include a benchmark for the PubMedQA dataset using the `hasBenchmark` property. 

    The query then filters the papers to get the ones that have a title and an ID, using the `hasTitle` and `hasId` properties, respectively. 

    Finally, the query returns the titles and IDs of the research papers that include a benchmark for the PubMedQA dataset. 

    Please note that the actual implementation may vary depending on the specific requirements and the structure of the Open Research Knowledge Graph.
