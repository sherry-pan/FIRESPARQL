Okay, I need to figure out which model has the highest Percentage error score on the SVRN benchmark dataset. Let me start by breaking down the question. The key terms here are "model" and "SVRN benchmark dataset." 

First, I'll look through the provided context information to find any mentions of models and datasets. From the context, I see several resources like R147244 which has a value of 93.9, but I'm not sure what that refers to. There's also R284316 which talks about a journal article involving entity recognition and linking, but again, not directly related to models or the SVRN dataset.

Wait, maybe I should focus on the steps mentioned. Steps 1 through 5 describe a process involving seed terms like SVM and MNIST, which are a model and a dataset. So SVM is a model, and MNIST is a dataset. The context also mentions using SciBERT for term expansion and k-means clustering, which are techniques but not models themselves.

Looking further, there's a mention of a CRF algorithm in Step 4, which is a type of model, but I'm not sure if it's the one with the highest error score. The context doesn't explicitly state the error scores for each model, but R147244 has a value of 93.9, which could be an error rate. If that's the case, then the model associated with that resource might be the one with the highest score.

I also see that R147246 and R284317 mention various authors and venues, but no specific models or datasets related to SVRN. The only dataset mentioned is MNIST, which is different from SVRN. So perhaps the model in question is SVM, which is paired with MNIST, but since the question is about SVRN, I might be missing something.

Wait, maybe the context doesn't have information about SVRN, so I have to infer based on the given data. The highest value I see is 93.9, which is likely an error score. If that's associated with a model, then that model would have the highest Percentage error score. Since SVM is mentioned as a seed term, perhaps it's the model in question.

So, putting it together, the model that achieved the highest Percentage error score on the SVRN benchmark dataset is likely SVM with a score of 93.9.
