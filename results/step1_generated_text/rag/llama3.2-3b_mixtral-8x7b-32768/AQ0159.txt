Question:
What models are being evaluated on the MedSTS dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
     PREFIX orkg: <http://www.openresearch.org/orkg/>
     PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearch.org/orkgc/>
     PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearch.org/orkgp/>

     SELECT?model
     WHERE {
   ?model orkg:relatedTo?dataset.
   ?dataset orkggc:hasDataset?dataset.
   ?dataset orkggc:hasDataset?evaluation.
   ?model orkgp:hasModel?model.
    FILTER (STRLIKE(STR(?model), "MedSTS"))
}
```
    I have already set up the prefixes for the SPARQL query. I just need you to fill in the query with the appropriate values.

Note: This is a SPARQL query, so the answer to the question "What models are being evaluated on the MedSTS dataset?" will be a list of models that are being evaluated on the MedSTS dataset.
