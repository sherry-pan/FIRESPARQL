Question:
Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WMT2016 English-Romanian dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasDataset?dataset_wmt.
 ?dataset_wmt rdfs:label "WMT2016 English-Romanian dataset"@en.
 ?paper ora:hasModel?model.
 ?model ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:hasDataset?dataset_wmt.
 ?paper ora:hasTitle?title.
 ?paper ora:id?id.
  FILTER (?title IS NOT NULL)
  FILTER (?id IS NOT NULL)
}
```

## Step 1: Analyze the question
The question asks to provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WMT2016 English-Romanian dataset.

## Step 2: Extract relevant terms from the question
The main entities are "research paper titles," "IDs," "benchmarked models," and the specific dataset "WMT2016 English-Romanian." The properties involved would be things like "benchmarked on" or "has dataset."

## Step 3: Look at the context data
Two main resources are mentioned: R147652 and R284316, along with R284317. R147652 seems to describe a method involving steps for named entity recognition, using datasets like MNIST and models like SVM. R284316 talks about a journal article focused on extracting entity knowledge using various tools and datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP. R284317 is another paper with authors and a DOI.

## Step 4: Determine the most similar paper
Since there's no explicit mention of WMT2016, the closest related paper is R284316, which discusses entity recognition and linking, though it uses different datasets.

## Step 5: Generate the SPARQL query
```sparql
SELECT?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasDataset?dataset_wmt.
 ?dataset_wmt rdfs:label "WMT2016 English-Romanian dataset"@en.
 ?paper ora:hasModel?model.
 ?model ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:hasDataset?dataset_wmt.
 ?paper ora:hasTitle?title.
 ?paper ora:id?id.
  FILTER (?title IS NOT NULL)
  FILTER (?id IS NOT NULL)
}
```

The final answer is: 
```
## Output SPARQL Query
```sparql
SELECT?title?id
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasDataset?dataset_wmt.
 ?dataset_wmt rdfs:label "WMT2016 English-Romanian dataset"@en.
 ?paper ora:hasModel?model.
 ?model ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:hasDataset?dataset_wmt.
 ?paper ora:hasTitle?title.
 ?paper ora:id?id.
  FILTER (?title IS NOT NULL)
  FILTER (?id IS NOT NULL)
}
