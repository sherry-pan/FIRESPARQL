Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Flair-TDM model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:

Note that the original query was filtered to include only the top 10 results, so I have left that part of the query intact. Also, the code label was selected as the property to order the results, since it was not specified which one to use in the prompt. The code label was selected as the property to filter the results, since the prompt asked for the papers that utilized the Flair-TDM model. The filter was changed to `str(?model_lbl) = "Flair-TDM"` to make the filter case-insensitive. 

The final answer is: SELECT DISTINCT?code?code_lbl
WHERE {
 ?model        a            orkgc:Model;
                rdfs:label  ?model_lbl.
