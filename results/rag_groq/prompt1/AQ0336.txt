Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this question using the given context. The question is asking for a list of models tested on the NLP-TDMS (Exp, arXiv only) benchmark dataset. 

First, I look through the context provided. I see several resources listed with their URIs, labels, and some have types like Resource, Contribution, Venue, etc. I need to find any mentions of models or datasets related to NLP-TDMS.

Looking at the context, I see resources like R76234 labeled "BabelEnconding" and R76243 which talks about measuring similarity using cosine similarity. There's R76244 labeled "Team 2 Subtask 1 English". R75430 is a venue called "IBM Journal of Research and Development". R75431 is "Contribution 1". R75840 and R75841 are about factors in humanitarian response and a paper, respectively.

Then, in the second part of the context, there are resources like R46464 which describes a comparison generated from NLP publications, mentioning Named Entity Recognition, Sentence Similarity Learning, and Machine Reading. R70729 is about TiO2 nc-films, which seems unrelated. R50803 and others have some properties like P27, P28, P29, which might be related to methods or results, but I don't see a direct link to NLP-TDMS.

I don't see any explicit mention of the NLP-TDMS dataset or any models tested on it in the provided context. The resources mentioned are about various NLP tasks and contributions but not specifically about benchmark datasets named NLP-TDMS.

Since the context doesn't provide information about the NLP-TDMS dataset or any models associated with it, I can't retrieve any relevant entities or properties. Therefore, the top similar entities or properties based on the given data would be an empty list.

The given context does not contain any information related to the NLP-TDMS benchmark dataset or models tested on it. Therefore, no similar entities or properties can be retrieved.
