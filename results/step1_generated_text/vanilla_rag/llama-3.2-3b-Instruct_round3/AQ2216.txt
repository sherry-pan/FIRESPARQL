Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the LayerNorm HM-LSTM model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?paper?code
     WHERE {
    ?paper orkg:HAS_METHOD orkg:LayerNorm HM-LSTM.
    ?paper orkg:HAS_IMPLEMENTATION?code.
     FILTER (str(?code) LIKE "%LayerNorm HM-LSTM%")
     }<|eot_id|>
