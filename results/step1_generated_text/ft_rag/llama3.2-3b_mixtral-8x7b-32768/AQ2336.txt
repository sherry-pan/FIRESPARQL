Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the DQN-PixelCNN model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
       orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_PAPER.
       orkgp:R1 orkgp:HAS_CODE.
       orkgp:HAS_CODE rdfs:label?code.
       FILTER(REGEX(?code, "DQN-PixelCNN"))
     }     


    NOTE: The provided SPARQL query may not be correct, as it was generated based on the input question and the given context. It may need to be adjusted according to the actual structure of the ORKG. 

    This task requires the ability to understand the natural language question, identify the required entities and properties, and generate a SPARQL query that can retrieve the correct information from the ORKG. The task also requires the ability to use the provided context to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG. 

    The SPARQL query should be able to retrieve the links to the code of the papers that utilize the DQN-PixelCNN model. The query should be able to handle the cases where the papers are linked to multiple venues or authors. 

    The query should also be able to handle the cases where the papers are linked to multiple code repositories.
