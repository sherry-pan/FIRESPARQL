Question:
What is the best performing model benchmarking the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset in terms of FLOPS metric?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?metric?value
WHERE {
 ?model rdfs:label?model_label.
 ?model orkgc:has_metric?metric.
 ?metric rdfs:label?metric_label.
 ?model orkgp:has_benchmarking?benchmarking.
 ?benchmarking rdfs:label?benchmarking_label.
  FILTER (?benchmarking_label = "benchmarking".
  FILTER (?metric_label = "FLOPS".
 ?model orkg:has_dataset?dataset.
 ?dataset rdfs:label?dataset_label.
  FILTER (?dataset_label = "Oxford-IIIT_Pets_dataset".
 ?model rdfs:label?model_label.
 ?model orkg:has_score?score.
  FILTER (?score IS NUMERIC.
 ?model orkg:has_model?best_model.
 ?best_model rdfs:label?best_model_label.
  FILTER (?best_model_label =?model_label.
  RETURNING?model?metric?value.
}
```
    This query is based on the information in the context and the extracted terms. It first finds the best performing model for the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset in terms of FLOPS metric. The query then filters the results to only include models that have been benchmarked on this dataset and have FLOPS as the metric. Finally, it returns the best performing model, its metric, and its score. 

    The `SELECT` clause specifies that we want to retrieve the `?model`, `?metric`, and `?value` variables. The `WHERE` clause contains the filtering and matching logic. The `FILTER` functions are used to filter the results based on the extracted terms and the context information. The `RETURNING` clause specifies the variables that we want to return. 

    Note that this query assumes that the `orkgr` namespace contains the RDF data dump, and that the `orkgp` namespace contains the properties used in the query. The actual namespace and property names may vary depending on the specific RDF data dump being used. 

    Also note that this query may not return any results if there are no models that match the specified criteria. In such cases, the query may return an empty result set. 

    To execute this query, you can use a SPARQL query engine such as SPARQL Query Language (SPARQL) or a graphical user interface such as GraphDB or Virtuoso. 

    The output of the query will be a list of triples that match the specified criteria. Each triple will contain the `?model`, `?metric`, and `?value` variables. The `?value` variable will contain the score of the best performing model. 

    For example, the output may look like this:

    ```
?model?metric?value
Oxford-IIIT_Pets_dataset FLOPS 1000.0
```

    This indicates that the best performing model for the Oxford-IIIT Pets dataset in terms of FLOPS metric is a model with a score of 1000.0. 

    Note that the actual output will depend on the specific RDF data dump and the query engine being used. 

    To get the actual output, you need to execute the query using a SPARQL query engine. 

    For example, you can use the `sparql` command-line tool to execute the query like this:

    ```bash
sparql --query "SELECT?model?metric?value WHERE {...}" --data "your_rdf_data_file.ttl"
```

    Replace "your_rdf_data_file.ttl" with the actual file name of your RDF data file. 

    The `--query` option specifies the SPARQL query to be executed. The `--data` option specifies the RDF data file to be used. 

    The actual output will depend on the specific RDF data dump and the query engine being used. 

    To get the actual output, you need to execute the query using a SPARQL query engine. 

    For example, you can use the `GraphDB` graphical user interface to execute the query like this:

    1. Open GraphDB and navigate to the "Query" tab.
    2. Enter the SPARQL query in the "Query" field.
    3. Click the "Execute" button to execute the query.
    4. The output will be displayed in the "Result" field. 

    The actual output will depend on the specific RDF data dump and the query engine being used. 

    To get the actual output, you need to execute the query using a SPARQL query engine. 

    For example, you can use the `Virtuoso` graphical user interface to execute the query like this:

    1. Open Virtuoso and navigate to the "Query" tab.
    2. Enter the SPARQL query in the "Query" field.
    3.
