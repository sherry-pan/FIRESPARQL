Question:
Provide a list of benchmarked datasets related to the Reading Comprehension research area?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgc: <http://example.org/orkgc#>
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp#>

SELECT?dataset?datasetLabel
WHERE {
 ?dataset orkggc:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkggc:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset orkgp:hasResearchArea?researchArea.
 ?researchArea orkggc:label?researchAreaLabel.
 ?researchArea orkggc:hasLabel?datasetLabel.
  FILTER(?researchArea orkggc:label "Reading Comprehension".
        ?dataset orkggc:label "benchmarked datasets" )
}
```sparql

Note that the actual SPARQL query may vary based on the actual data in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). The above query is based on the provided context and is intended to illustrate the correct answer. 

This task requires the ability to understand natural language questions, extract relevant entities and properties, and generate a SPARQL query to query the ORKG. The generated SPARQL query should be able to retrieve the correct answer to the input question. 

The task requires the ability to reason about the context, extract relevant entities and properties, and generate a SPARQL query that can query the ORKG. The generated SPARQL query should be able to retrieve the correct answer to the input question.
