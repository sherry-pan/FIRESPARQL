    PREFIX orkq: <http://example.org/orkq/>

    SELECT?benchmarkResult?metric?value
    WHERE {
     ?benchmarkResult a orkp:BenchmarkResult.
     ?benchmarkResult orkp:hasBenchmarkResult?bestResult.
     ?bestResult orkp:hasBestResult?result.
     ?result orkp:hasMetric?metric.
     ?result orkp:hasValue?value.
     ?result orkp:hasDataset?dataset.
     ?dataset orkg:RDFType orkp:Dataset.
     ?dataset orkp:hasDataset?fsnsDataset.
     ?fsnsDataset orkp:RDFType orkg:Resource.
