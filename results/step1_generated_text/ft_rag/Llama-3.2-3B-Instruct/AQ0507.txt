Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the TempEval-3 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?title?paper_id
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
           FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "TempEval-3")
          ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
          ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
          ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                      orkgp:P32               ?benchmark.
          ?paper         rdfs:label              ?title.
          ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?paper_id.
     }     ```



SELECT?title?paper_id
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                 rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "TempEval-3")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
 ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                orkgp:P32               ?benchmark.
 ?paper         rdfs:label              ?title.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?paper_id.
}     ```



    The provided context and question require generating a SPARQL query to retrieve research papers that include a benchmark for the TempEval-3 dataset. The query should filter the results based on the presence of the dataset name and retrieve the titles and IDs of the relevant papers.

    The generated SPARQL query is as follows:

    ```
    SELECT?title?paper_id
    WHERE {
     ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                     rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
      FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "TempEval-3")
     ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset.
     ?cont          orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
     ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?cont;
                    orkgp:P32               ?benchmark.
     ?paper         rdfs:label              ?title.
     ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?paper_id.
    }
    ```

    This query uses the following variables:

    *   `?title`: The title of the research paper.
    *   `?paper_id`: The ID of the research paper.

    The query works as follows:

    1.  It selects the `?title` and `?paper_id` variables from the graph.
    2.  It filters the results to include only datasets labeled as "TempEval-3".
    3.  It then iterates through the filtered datasets and their corresponding benchmarks.
    4.  For each benchmark, it retrieves the contributing papers and their titles.
    5.  Finally, it returns the titles and IDs of the relevant papers.

    This query can be executed on the ORKG RDF data to retrieve the desired research papers.<|eot_id|>
