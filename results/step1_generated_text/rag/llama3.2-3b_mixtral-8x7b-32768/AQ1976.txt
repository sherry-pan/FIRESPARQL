Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the SEE model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    SELECT?code?paper?benchmark?see_model
    WHERE {
     ?code orkgp:HAS_CODE?paper.
     ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?benchmark.
     ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?see_model.
     ?see_model orkgr:R123456.
    }
    ```



## Step 1: Understand the given context
The context provides a natural language question, "Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the SEE model?" along with extracted terms and candidates in the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). The extracted terms are "code", "papers", "benchmark", and "SEE model", and the candidates include specific URIs and labels for these terms.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant terms and their URIs
From the context, we can see that the relevant terms are "code", "papers", "benchmark", and "SEE model". Their corresponding URIs are provided in the "candidates" section.

## Step 3: Construct the SPARQL query
To generate the SPARQL query, we need to construct a query that filters the code used in papers that benchmark the SEE model. We can do this by using the "HAS_CODE", "HAS_PAPER", "HAS_BENCHMARK", and "R123456" URIs.

## Step 4: Write the SPARQL query
The SPARQL query should select the code, papers, benchmark, and SEE model URIs that satisfy the conditions. The query should be as follows:
```
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
SELECT?code?paper?benchmark?see_model
WHERE {
 ?code orkgp:HAS_CODE?paper.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?see_model.
 ?see_model orkgr:R123456.
}
```

The final answer is: 
```
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
SELECT?code?paper?benchmark?see_model
WHERE {
 ?code orkgp:HAS_CODE?paper.
 ?paper orkgp:HAS_PAPER?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?see_model.
 ?see_model orkgr:R123456.
}
