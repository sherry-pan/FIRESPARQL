Question:
Can you list the metrics used to evaluate models on the TSE-NER dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?metric?dataset 
    WHERE {
   ?dataset orkgr:hasMetric?metric.
    FILTER (regex(?dataset, "TSE-NER")).
    } 

    Explanation:
    The question is asking for a list of metrics used to evaluate models on the TSE-NER dataset. The SPARQL query will first filter the resources in the ORKG that have a metric, and then filter those resources that contain the string "TSE-NER". The result will be the metrics used to evaluate models on the TSE-NER dataset.
    The reason we are using the ORKG's built-in metric property and the built-in resource property is because the question is asking for a list of metrics, not the evaluation or the dataset itself. Also, the ORKG provides a built-in way to filter resources using regex, which is what we use to filter the dataset. 

    This is an example of a query that uses the SPARQL query language to ask a question that requires the use of a knowledge graph. The query is designed to extract information from the ORKG and answer the user's question. The query is a combination of the question's requirements and the ORKG's structure, and it uses the built-in properties and predicates of the ORKG to answer the question. 

    This type of query is useful for answering questions that require the use of a knowledge graph, such as information retrieval, question answering, and natural language processing. The query can be used to extract information from the ORKG and provide answers to a wide range of questions. 

    In this example, the query is designed to extract the metrics used to evaluate models on the TSE-NER dataset. The query uses the built-in metric property and the built-in resource property to filter the resources in the ORKG that have a metric and contain the string "TSE-NER". The result will be a list of metrics used to evaluate models on the TSE-NER dataset. 

    The query can be modified to answer different questions by changing the filter conditions and the predicates used. For example, to answer the question "What is the TSE-NER dataset?", the query would need to be modified to filter for the dataset property instead of the metric property. 

    The query can also be modified to answer questions that require the use of different predicates or properties. For example, to answer the question "What are the metrics used to evaluate models on the TSE-NER dataset?", the query would need to be modified to use the ORKG's built-in metric property and the built-in evaluation property instead of the built-in metric property and the built-in resource property. 

    The query can also be modified to answer questions that require the use of different filter conditions. For example, to answer the question "What are the metrics
