Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer this query using the given context. The query is asking to list the code links in papers that use the DDQN-PC model in any benchmark. But looking at the context provided, I don't see any information about the DDQN-PC model or code links. The context has various resources like papers, evaluations, and contributions, but none of them mention DDQN-PC or benchmarks related to it. 

I should check each resource in the context to see if any are related. For example, there's a paper titled "NNE: A Dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire" and another called "Neural Modeling for Named Entities and Morphology (NEMO2)", but these don't seem related to DDQN-PC. There's also a resource about BabelEnconding and another on measuring similarity between embeddings, but again, nothing about the specific model mentioned.

Since the context doesn't have any relevant entities or properties related to the query, I can't retrieve any similar entities. Therefore, the top 5 similar entities would be an empty list because there's no matching information available in the provided data dump.

The query asks for code links in papers using the DDQN-PC model, but the context doesn't contain any relevant entities or properties related to this model. Therefore, no similar entities can be retrieved.
