Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the SciREX dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?paper?id
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:ResearchPaper.
 ?paper ora:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
 ?benchmark ora:hasDataset?dataset.
 ?dataset rdfs:label "SciREX"@en.
 ?paper ora:hasPaper?id.
  FILTER (lang(?paper) = "en" \u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0\u00A0lang(?id) = "en" )
}
```
    Note: The actual output might vary slightly depending on the actual implementation of the system, but the query above should be the expected query based on the provided context and the question.

    Note: The `rdfs:label` and `rdf:type` prefixes are used to refer to specific properties in the RDF schema vocabulary.

    Note: The `hasBenchmark`, `hasDataset`, `hasPaper`, and `hasBenchmark` predicates are used to represent the relationships between the entities and properties in the ORKG.

    Note: The `FILTER` clause is used to filter the results to only include papers with English titles and IDs.

    Note: The `lang` function is used to get the language of the text.

    Note: The `@en` suffix is used to specify the language of the label.
