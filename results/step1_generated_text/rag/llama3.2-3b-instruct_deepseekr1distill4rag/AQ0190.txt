Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the ShARe/CLEF eHealth corpus dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?model?dataset
WHERE {
 ?model orkgr:evaluatedOn?dataset.
  SERVICE orkgr.sparql
  {
   ?dataset a orkgc:Resource.
   ?model a rdfs:Class.
  }
}
```    Note: The answer is a SPARQL query that lists the models that have been evaluated on the ShARe/CLEF eHealth corpus dataset. The query uses the `orkgr` prefix for resources and `orkgr:evaluatedOn` property. The `SERVICE orkgr.sparql` clause is used to query the ORKG RDF data dump. The `?model` and `?dataset` variables are used to bind the results to the SPARQL query.<|eot_id|>
