Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Amazon-2 dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data. 

First, I'll break down the question. The key terms here are "evaluation metrics, "benchmarking models," and "Amazon-2 dataset." So, I need to extract these terms from the question.

Looking at the context data, I see several resources and predicates. For example, there's a resource R147656 with a predicate P28 that has the value "6". Another resource R147244 has a value of "93.9". These might be related to evaluation metrics like accuracy or F1-score.

I also notice that there are resources related to models and datasets. For instance, R147246 is connected to authors and venues, which might not be directly relevant, but R283710 mentions "Graph analytics" and "Horizon 2020," which could be related to benchmarking.

I need to find the top 5 most similar entities or properties. Since the question is about evaluation metrics, I'll focus on resources that have values like "93.9" or "6" as these could represent metrics. 

I'll list the candidates under each extracted term. For "evaluation metrics," I'll include resources with these values. For "benchmarking models," I'll look for terms like "HAS_BENCHMARK" or "HAS_MODEL. For "Amazon-2 dataset," I'll check if there's a specific resource, but since it's not mentioned, I'll include relevant dataset predicates.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their top candidates, ensuring the URIs use the correct prefixes and include their types.
