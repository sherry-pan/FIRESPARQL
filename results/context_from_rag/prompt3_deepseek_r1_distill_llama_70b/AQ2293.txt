Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the query using the provided context. The query is asking to list the code links in papers that use the Duel noop model in any benchmark. 

First, I'll break down the query to extract the relevant terms. The key entities here are "Duel noop model" and "code links." The property is "use" as in papers that use the model.

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a method with steps, and R147246 and R283710 are papers with authors and venues. 

I need to find entities similar to "Duel noop model." In the context, there are mentions of models like "SVM" and datasets like "MNIST." These could be related, but not exactly the same. I'll list these as candidates.

Next, for "code links," the context doesn't have direct mentions, but I can infer that papers might have links or venues. So, I'll include resources related to papers and their venues as candidates.

For the property "use," the context has predicates like P27 (authors), P28 (year), and P29 (venue). These can be linked as properties indicating usage.

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and their top candidates, ensuring the URIs use the correct prefixes and include types where possible.
