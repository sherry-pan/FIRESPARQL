Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the query: "Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the SciERC dataset." using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I should understand what the user is asking for. They want research papers that have used the SciERC dataset for benchmarks. So, I need to look through the context information to find any mentions of such papers.

Looking at the context, I see several resources labeled as "Paper" with their titles. For example, R211524 is titled "NNE: A dataset for Nested Named Entity Recognition in English Newswire." Another one is R211327, but its label isn't specified. There's also R211319, which is a component for a template, and R211912, which is about Neural Modeling for named entities and morphology.

I don't see any explicit mention of the SciERC dataset in the provided context. The papers listed are about NNE, NEMO2, etc., but none of them mention SciERC. So, based on the given data, there are no papers that have performed benchmarks on the SciERC dataset.

Therefore, the answer should reflect that no relevant papers were found in the provided data.

The provided context does not contain any research papers that have performed benchmarks on the SciERC dataset. Therefore, no relevant papers were found.
