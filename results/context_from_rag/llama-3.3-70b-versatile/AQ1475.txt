    "reason": "This property is directly related to the question as it represents the Accuracy score, which is the metric of interest."
  },
  {
    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71086",
    "label": "has training set",
    "reason": "The question mentions the Story Cloze Test benchmark dataset, which is likely a training or test set, making this property relevant to identify the dataset used."

    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71079",
    "label": "Recall",
    "reason": "Although the question specifically asks about Accuracy, Recall is another evaluation metric that might be related to the model's performance, making it a potentially relevant property."

    "property_iri": "http://orkg.org/orkg/predicate/P71080",
    "label": "micro-F1",
    "reason": "Similar to Recall, micro-F1 is an evaluation metric that could be related to the model's performance on the Story Cloze Test benchmark dataset."

    "label": "third prize comment",
    "reason": "This property might be relevant if the question is related to a competition or challenge where models are ranked based on their performance, and the third prize comment could provide additional context."
