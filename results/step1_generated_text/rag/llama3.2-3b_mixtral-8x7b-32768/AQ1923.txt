Question:
List the code links in papers that use the Long Short Transformer model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/resource/>
    PREFIX rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#>
    PREFIX rdf: <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#>
    
    SELECT?codeLink?paper
    WHERE {
     ?paper orkg:uses?model.
     ?model rdfs:label "Long Short Transformer model"@en.
     ?paper orkg:hasCodeLink?codeLink.
     ?codeLink rdf:type orkg:CodeLink.
     ?paper orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
     ?benchmark rdfs:label "benchmark"@en.
     ?benchmark orkg:hasBenchmark?benchmark.
    }
    ```


## Step 1: Understand the context provided
The context includes the input question, extracted terms, and candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.

## Step 2: Identify the relevant entities and properties
From the context, we can identify the relevant entities and properties as follows:
- Entities: "Long Short Transformer model", "code links", "papers", "benchmark"
- Properties: "uses", "hasCodeLink", "hasBenchmark", "rdf:type"

## Step 3: Determine the SPARQL query structure
To list the code links in papers that use the Long Short Transformer model in any benchmark, we need to find papers that use the model and have a code link, and also have a benchmark. The SPARQL query should select the code links and papers that satisfy these conditions.

## Step 4: Write the SPARQL query
The SPARQL query should be written as follows:
```sparql
SELECT?codeLink
