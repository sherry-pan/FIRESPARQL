Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkg/predicate/>
    SELECT?metric?dataset 
    WHERE {
     ?metric orkgp:Evaluation_Method orkgr:benchmarking_models_on orkgr:Habitat_2020_Object_Nav_test-std_dataset.
     ?metric orkgr:evaluation_metrics.
     ?dataset orkgr:Habitat_2020_Object_Nav_test-std_dataset.
     ?metric orkgr:validation_research.
     ?metric orkgr:technique.
    }
    ``` 
    Please note that the URIs in the SPARQL query are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual URIs from the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question. It selects the metrics and datasets that are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std dataset. The query uses the property "Evaluation Method" to link the metrics and datasets, and the properties "evaluation metrics" and "benchmarking models on" to filter the results. 

    Please note that this is just one possible way to generate a SPARQL query for this question, and there may be other valid queries depending on the specific structure and content of the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to be executed on the ORKG, and the results will depend on the actual data in the graph. 

    The query is written in the SPARQL 1.1 query language, which is a standard language for querying RDF data. 

    The query uses the following prefixes:
    - `orkgr`: The prefix for the ORKG RDF data dump.
    - `orkgp`: The prefix for the ORKG predicate RDF data dump.
    The query uses the following variables:
    - `?metric`: A variable to represent the metric.
    - `?dataset`: A variable to represent the dataset.
    The query uses the following triple patterns:
    - `?metric orkgp:Evaluation_Method orkgr:Habitat_2020_Object_Nav_test-std_dataset.`: This triple pattern links a metric to the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std dataset using the "Evaluation Method" property.
    - `?metric orkgr:evaluation_metrics.`: This triple pattern links a metric to the "evaluation metrics" property.
    - `?dataset orkgr:Habitat_2020_Object_Nav_test-std_dataset.`: This triple pattern links a dataset to the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std dataset.
    - `?metric orkgr:validation_research.`: This triple pattern links a metric to the "validation research" property.
    - `?metric orkgr:technique.`: This triple pattern links a metric to the "technique" property. 

    The query is designed to return a list of metrics and datasets that are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Habitat 2020 Object Nav test-std dataset. The results will depend on the actual data in the graph.
