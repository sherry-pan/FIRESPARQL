Okay, so I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Provide a list of papers that have utilized the ANODE model and include the links to their code?" using the provided ORKG RDF data. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "papers" and "ANODE model". The action mentioned is "utilized, links to their code". So, I'm looking for papers that have used the ANODE model and any associated code links.

Looking at the context data, I see several resources. For example, R147246 and R283710 are papers with authors and publication details. R147244 has a value of 93.9, which might be an accuracy score or something similar. R283709 talks about methods like entity extraction and named entity recognition, which might relate to models like ANODE if they're NLP models.

I need to find which of these papers mention the ANODE model. Scanning through, I don't see ANODE explicitly mentioned, but R283709 is about entity extraction and NER, which could be related. Maybe ANODE is used there. Also, R147246 is about a method with steps involving NER approaches, which might align with ANODE.

Next, I need to find the top similar entities or properties. Since ANODE isn't directly mentioned, I'll look for papers that discuss similar models or methods. R283709 and R147246 seem relevant because they discuss NER and entity extraction, which ANODE is known for.

For each extracted term, I'll list the top 5 candidates. For "papers", I'll include R147246 and R283710. For "ANODE model", since it's not present, I'll look for related models or methods in the data. "Links to their code" might correspond to properties like P27, which mentions authors, but I'm not sure if that's directly related to code links.

I'll structure the JSON output as specified, grouping the results by the extracted terms. Each candidate should have a URI, label, and type. Since ANODE isn't in the data, I'll infer based on related methods.

I think I've covered all the steps, but I'm a bit unsure about the code links part since the data doesn't explicitly mention code URLs. Maybe the authors' information can lead to finding their code repositories, but that's an assumption.
