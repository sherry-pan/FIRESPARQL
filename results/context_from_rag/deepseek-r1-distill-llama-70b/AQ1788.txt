Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to answering the question about the best performing model on the Atari 2600 Montezuma's Revenge dataset, specifically looking at the Average Return (NoOp) metric.

First, I'll break down the question. It's asking about model performance on a specific dataset and metric. So, I should look for properties related to benchmarks, models, datasets, and specific metrics.

Looking through the JSON, I see properties like "has benchmark" which seems directly related because benchmarks are used to evaluate models. Then there's "evaluation" which would include metrics like Average Return. "Has dataset" is also relevant because the question is about a specific dataset. 

I also notice "method" which could refer to the model or approach used. "Implementation" might be useful if it's about how the model is set up. "Has approach" could relate to the methodology of the model. "Average Return (NoOp)" isn't directly in the JSON, but "evaluation" could cover that metric.

So, I'll list these properties and explain why each is relevant. They all tie into different aspects of the question, from the dataset to the evaluation metrics and the models themselves.
