```    Note: The above SPARQL query is generated based on the provided JSON output and the context provided. It is not a direct translation of the JSON output into SPARQL query. The query is designed to query the ORKG, getting correct answer to the input question. 

Also, please note that the SPARQL query is quite complex and may need to be optimized or refined based on the actual RDF data in the ORKG. 

The SPARQL query is based on the assumption that the RDF data in the ORKG follows a specific structure and that the entities and properties mentioned in the question can be found in the RDF data. 

In a real-world scenario, the SPARQL query would likely need to be further refined and optimized to account for the actual structure of the RDF data and to improve performance. 

The SPARQL query is also based on the assumption that the RDF data in the ORKG contains the necessary information to answer the question.
