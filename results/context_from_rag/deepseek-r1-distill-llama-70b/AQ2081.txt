Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are most relevant to the question about providing links to code used in papers that benchmark the BiDAF + Self Attention + ELMo (single model) model. 

First, the question is asking for code links, so I should look for properties related to code, implementation, or benchmarks. 

Looking through the JSON, I see properties like "has implementation" which seems directly related because it likely points to where the code is implemented. Then there's "evaluation" which might contain benchmarks. "method" could be relevant because it describes the model setup. "approach" might explain how the model was applied. "has dataset" could be useful if the code is tied to specific datasets. "has benchmark" is also relevant as it's about benchmarking. 

I should list these properties with their IRIs and explain why each is relevant. So, I'll include "has implementation", "evaluation", "method", "approach", "has dataset", and "has benchmark". Each of these helps in locating the code or understanding how the model was benchmarked.
