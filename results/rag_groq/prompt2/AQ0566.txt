Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context. The user is asking for a list of research papers that have performed benchmarks on the MLDoc Zero-Shot English-to-Russian dataset. 

First, I'll look through the context information. The context includes RDF data from two files. Each file has several triples describing resources, predicates, and objects. 

Looking at the first file, I see entries related to a resource R147652, which describes a method involving steps like seed terms, expansion, annotation, NER approach, and filtering. There are also some metrics and authors associated with another resource, R147246, which seems to be a publication with authors like Ligia Sierra, Betty L LÃ³pez, etc., published in 2015, volume 6.

The second file describes resource R284316, which is about a research article titled "validation research" with a technique involving NLP tasks like NER and entity linking. It's published in 2021, volume 11, with authors Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta, and has a DOI link.

Now, the user is asking about papers that used the MLDoc Zero-Shot English-to-Russian dataset. I need to check if any of these papers mention this dataset. 

Looking at R284316, the abstract discusses extracting entity knowledge using tools like Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight, and mentions datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP. There's no mention of MLDoc Zero-Shot English-to-Russian dataset here.

Similarly, R147246's context doesn't mention this dataset either. It talks about seed terms, SVM, MNIST, and a NER approach but doesn't reference MLDoc.

Since neither of the provided papers in the context mention the MLDoc dataset, there are no relevant papers to list. Therefore, the candidates for the dataset and the papers are empty.
