Question:
Can you list the models that have been evaluated on the STS Benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT DISTINCT?model
WHERE {
 ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                  rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "STS Benchmark")
 ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                  orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
 ?paper         orkgp:P31               ?eval,
                orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
 ?contrib      orkgp:P31               ?paper;
                rdfs:label              ?contrib_lbl.
 ?model       rdfs:label              ?contrib_lbl;
                orkgp:P32               ?model.
}
```    Note that the provided context and explanation are not part of the output. The output is only the SPARQL query. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to query the ORKG RDF data and returns the models that have been evaluated on the STS Benchmark dataset. The query uses the `FILTER` function to match the dataset label with the string "STS Benchmark". It then uses the `?paper` and `?contrib` resources to find the models that have been evaluated. The `?model` resource is used to filter the results based on the model labels. The `SELECT DISTINCT` statement is used to return only unique model URIs. 

    The query is based on the context provided, where the model evaluation is linked to the `orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK` and `orkgp:HAS_DATASET` properties. The dataset is filtered to match the label "STS Benchmark" using the `FILTER` function. The `str(?dataset_lbl) = "STS Benchmark"` filter ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive. 

    The query is designed to return the models that have been evaluated on the STS Benchmark dataset, even if the dataset is not explicitly mentioned in the RDF data. The query uses the `rdfs:label` property to match the model labels with the dataset label. 

    The query can be executed on the ORKG RDF data to retrieve the models that have been evaluated on the STS Benchmark dataset. 

    The output of the query will be the URIs of the models that have been evaluated on the STS Benchmark dataset. The output will include only the distinct model URIs. 

    The query can be modified to retrieve additional information about the models, such as their labels or evaluation metrics. 

    The query can also be used to retrieve models that have been evaluated on different datasets by modifying the `FILTER` condition to match the desired dataset label. 

    The query can be executed on different ORKG RDF data dumps to retrieve models that have been evaluated on different datasets. 

    The query can also be used to retrieve models that have been evaluated on specific tasks or benchmarks by modifying the `orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK` and `orkgp:HAS_DATASET` properties. 

    The query can be used to retrieve models that have been evaluated on specific evaluation metrics or evaluation types by modifying the `orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION` property. 

    The query can be used to retrieve models that have been evaluated on specific types of data or data sources by modifying the `orkgp:HAS_DATASET` property. 

    The query can be used to retrieve models that have been evaluated on specific types of tasks or applications by modifying the `orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK` property. 

    The query can be used to retrieve models that have been evaluated on specific types of evaluation or testing methods by modifying the `orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION` property. 

    The query can be used to retrieve models that have been evaluated on specific types of performance metrics or evaluation metrics by modifying the `orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION` property. 

    The query can be used to retrieve models that have been evaluated on specific types of data or data sources by modifying the `orkgp:HAS_DATASET` property.
