Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the A3C LSTM hs model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>

SELECT?paper?model?code_link
WHERE {
 ?paper orkc:relatedTo?model.
 ?paper orkp:has_code?code_link.
  FILTER (STR(?model) = "A3C LSTM hs").
}
``` 
    Note: You are expected to replace the `PREFIX` lines with the actual prefixes used in the RDF data dump. The actual prefixes used in the RDF data dump are not provided, so you should use the ones that match the actual URIs in the data. 

    Also, note that the `?code_link` variable is assumed to be a URI that represents the link to the code repository. You may need to modify the query to match the actual properties used to represent code links in the RDF data dump. 

    Finally, note that the query assumes that the RDF data dump contains the necessary information to answer the question. If the data does not contain the necessary information, the query will not return any results. 

    Please modify the query as necessary to match the actual RDF data dump.

    The final answer is the SPARQL query itself, not the output of the query.
