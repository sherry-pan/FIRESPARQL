Question:
Can you provide links to code used in papers that benchmark the Multi-Perspective Matching (single model) model?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkg/>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkp/>
    PREFIX orkc: <http://example.org/orkc/>
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>

    SELECT?p?o
    WHERE {
     ?o a orkg:ResearchPaper.
     ?o orkp:hasBenchmark?p.
     ?p orkp:hasModel?m.
     ?m rdfs:label "Multi-Perspective Matching (single model)".
     ?o orkp:hasCodeLink?o.
     ?o orkp:hasCodeLink?o.
      FILTER (lang(?o) = "en" )
    }
    ```    Note: The answer is in SPARQL query format. The actual answer is the output of the query. You need to execute the query on the ORKG to get the actual answer. 

    This output is the result of the SPARQL query, which is executed on the ORKG. The actual answer is the output of the query, which can be in various formats such as HTML, JSON, or CSV. 

    For the purpose of this task, the actual answer is the list of papers that benchmark the Multi-Perspective Matching (single model) model, along with their corresponding code links. 

    The actual answer is not provided here as it requires the execution of the SPARQL query on the ORKG. 

    However, the provided SPARQL query can be executed on the ORKG to get the actual answer. 

    The output of the query will be the list of papers that benchmark the Multi-Perspective Matching (single model) model, along with their corresponding code links. 

    The actual answer will be in a format such as HTML, JSON, or CSV, depending on the ORKG's output format. 

    The output of the query can be used to retrieve the actual answer, which can be in various formats.
