Question:
Provide a list of papers that have utilized the Funnel Transformer model and include the links to their code?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX ork: <http://example.org/orkgr/>

SELECT?paper?code
WHERE {
 ?paper a orkg:Paper.
 ?paper orkg:hasModel?model.
 ?model a orkg:Model.
 ?model orkg:hasName "Funnel Transformer model".
 ?model orkp:hasCode?code.
 ?paper orkp:hasLink?link.
 ?link a orkp:Link.
 ?link orkp:hasURI "https://example.com/paper/{paperId}".

Note that the SPARQL query is designed to query the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), but the actual query will need to be adapted to the actual URIs and prefixes used in the ORKG. 

Also note that the provided context does not contain any relevant information about the Funnel Transformer model, and therefore the query will likely not return any results. 

Please note that this is a hypothetical query, and you should adapt it to the actual structure of the ORKG and the URIs used in it. 

The query is designed to find papers that have utilized the Funnel Transformer model and include links to their code. It does this by:

1. Selecting the paper and its code.
2. Checking if the paper has a model with the name "Funnel Transformer model".
3. If the paper has a model, checking if the model has a code.
4. If the paper has a code, checking if the paper has a link with a URI that includes the paper's ID.
5. Grouping the results by paper and only returning papers with more than one code.
6. Ordering the results by paper and limiting the output to 100 papers.

Again, please note that this is a hypothetical query, and you should adapt it to the actual structure of the ORKG and the URIs used in it. 

Also, note that the actual query will need to be adapted to the actual structure of the ORKG and the URIs used in it. The provided context does not contain any relevant information about the Funnel Transformer model, and therefore the query will likely not return any results. 

Please let me know if you need any further assistance. 

Here is the final answer. 

The final answer is:

```
SELECT?paper?code
WHERE {
 ?paper a orkg:Paper.
 ?paper orkg:hasModel?model.
 ?model a orkg:Model.
 ?model orkg:hasName "Funnel Transformer model".
 ?model orkp:hasCode?code.
 ?paper orkp:hasLink?link.
 ?link a orkp:Link.
 ?link orkp:hasURI "https://example.com/paper/{paperId}".
  BIND(replace(str(?paperId), "_", "-") AS?paperId)
}
GROUP BY?paper
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT?code) > 0
ORDER BY?paper
LIMIT 100
```<|eot_id|>
