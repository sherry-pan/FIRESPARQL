Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of F1 metric on the CoNLL 2012 benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/rdf/>
PREFIX orkp: <http://orkp.org/rdf/>

SELECT?model?f1Metric
WHERE {
 ?model orkp:hasValue?f1Metric.
 ?f1Metric orkp:hasValue?CoNLL_2012_benchmark_dataset.
 ?f1Metric orkp:hasValue "F1-score".
 ?CoNLL_2012_benchmark_dataset orkp:hasValue "CoNLL-2012".
 ?CoNLL_2012_benchmark_dataset orkp:hasValue?model.
  FILTER (STR(?f1Metric) = "F1-score" AND STR(?CoNLL_2012_benchmark_dataset) = "CoNLL-2012" AND STR(?model) = "Flair NER" OR STR(?model) = "Stanford NER" ).
}

    Note that the actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the specific structure of the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Please note that the SPARQL query is generated based on the provided context and may not be the only possible query to answer the question. 

    Also note that the SPARQL query uses the `orkp` prefix to denote the ORKP predicates, and the `orkg` prefix to denote the ORKG resources. The `rdf` prefix is used for general RDF predicates. 

    The `SELECT` clause specifies the variables to be selected in the query result. In this case, we select the `model` and `f1Metric` variables. 

    The `WHERE` clause specifies the conditions under which the query will return a result. In this case, we filter the results based on the extracted terms and their corresponding URIs.
