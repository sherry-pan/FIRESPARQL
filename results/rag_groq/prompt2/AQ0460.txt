Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the query: "Provide a list of research paper titles and IDs that have benchmarked models on the WebQuestions dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "research paper titles", "models", and "WebQuestions dataset". The property involved is "benchmarked on".

Looking through the context, I see two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a research paper with steps involving SVM and MNIST, but it doesn't mention WebQuestions. R284316 is about a paper titled "validation research" that uses techniques like Stanford NER and DBpedia Spotlight, and it's evaluated on datasets like AIDA and MEANTIME, but not WebQuestions.

Since the context doesn't have any papers that benchmarked models on WebQuestions, I can't find any matches. Therefore, the candidates for each term will be empty.
