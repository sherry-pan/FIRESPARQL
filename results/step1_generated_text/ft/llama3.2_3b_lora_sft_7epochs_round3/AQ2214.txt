Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the All-attention network - 18 layers model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?code
     WHERE {
        ?paper rdf:type orkgc:Paper.
        ?paper orkgp:P30_0003 rdfs:label?title.
         FILTER(REGEX(?title, "All-attention network - 18 layers"))
        ?paper orkgp:P31_00144 rdfs:label?code.
        ?cont orkgp:P31_00144?paper.
        ?cont orkgp:P29_00123?benchmark.
     }<|eot_id|>
