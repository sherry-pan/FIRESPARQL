Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the AAPD dataset?

    SELECT?paper?title?id
    WHERE {
     ?paper a orkg:Paper.
     ?paper orkg:HAS_EVALUATION?evaluation.
     ?evaluation orkg:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
     ?benchmark orkg:HAS_DATASET?dataset.
     ?dataset csvw:identifier "AAPD".
     ?paper csvw:CSVW_Titles?title.
     ?paper csvw:CSVW_ID?id.
    }
   <|eot_id|>
