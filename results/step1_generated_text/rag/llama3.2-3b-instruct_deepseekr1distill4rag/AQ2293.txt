Question:
List the code links in papers that use the Duel noop model in any benchmark?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?code_link
WHERE {
 ?paper a ora:Paper.
 ?paper ora:uses?model.
 ?model ora:is_related_to?benchmark.
 ?paper ora:has_code_link?code_link.
 ?benchmark ora:has_benchmark?benchmark.
 ?model ora:is_equivalent_to?model.
 ?code_link ora:is_code_link?code_link.
  FILTER (?model = ora:Duel_noop_model)
  FILTER ( EXISTS {?benchmark ora:has_benchmark?benchmark } )
  FILTER ( EXISTS {?paper ora:uses?model } )
}
``` Sparql Query is generated based on the provided input question and context. The query retrieves papers that use the Duel noop model in any benchmark, and then filters those papers to only include those with code links. The query uses the following variables:
   ?paper: The paper that uses the Duel noop model.
   ?model: The Duel noop model.
   ?benchmark: The benchmark that the Duel noop model is related to.
   ?code_link: The code link associated with the paper.

The query also uses the following filters:
   ?model = ora:Duel_noop_model: This filter ensures that only papers that use the Duel noop model are included in the results.
    EXISTS {?benchmark ora:has_benchmark?benchmark }: This filter ensures that only papers that use the Duel noop model in a benchmark are included in the results.
    EXISTS {?paper ora:uses?model }: This filter ensures that only papers that use the Duel noop model are included in the results.

The query returns the paper and code link for each paper that uses the Duel noop model in any benchmark. The results are filtered to only include papers that have code links. The query uses the following SPARQL functions:
    a: This function is used to identify the type of the resource.
    ora:uses: This function is used to identify the model used by the paper.
    ora:is_related_to: This function is used to identify the benchmark related to the model.
    ora:has_code_link: This function is used to identify the code link associated with the paper.
    ora:is_code_link: This function is used to identify the code link.
    FILTER: This function is used to filter the results based on the conditions specified in the query.<|eot_id|>
