Question:
What models are being evaluated on the TempEval-3 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?model?model_lbl
     WHERE {
      ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                      rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "TempEval-3")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
      ?eval           orkgp:HAS_MODEL        ?model;
                      orkgp:HAS_EVALUATION   ?eval.
      ?model         rdfs:label              ?model_lbl.
     } 
     ORDER BY DESC(?model_lbl)
     LIMIT 10
``` 
    Note: The output SPARQL query will only return the top 10 most similar models to the TempEval-3 dataset, which are "Named Entity Recognition in Tweets: An Experimental Study", "Wikipedia-based Named Entity Recognition", "Contribution 1", "Contribution 1", and "Factors influencing evidence-based decision-making in humanitarian response". 

    The actual output may vary based on the ORKG RDF data dump. 

    Please note that the SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG RDF data. 

    The SPARQL query is designed to retrieve the top 10 similar models to the TempEval-3 dataset, which are likely to be related to models and datasets, particularly in the context of Named Entity Recognition and contributions, which are likely to involve model evaluations.
