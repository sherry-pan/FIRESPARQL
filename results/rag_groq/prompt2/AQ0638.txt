Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the title and ID of research papers that contain a benchmark over the TREC-6 dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. 

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "research papers" and "TREC-6 dataset". The property mentioned is "contain a benchmark over". 

Looking at the context, I see two main resources: R147246 and R284317. Both are research papers. R147246 has authors like Ligia Sierra and others, and it's from 2015. R284317 is from 2021 with authors Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta. 

Next, I need to check if these papers mention the TREC-6 dataset. The context doesn't explicitly mention TREC-6, but R284316 talks about extracting entity knowledge and mentions datasets like AIDA, MEANTIME, and TAC-KBP. Since TREC-6 isn't directly mentioned, I'll have to infer based on the information given.

I'll compute similarity scores for the terms. "Research papers" would match the resources R147246 and R284317. "TREC-6 dataset" doesn't have a direct match, but since R284316 discusses benchmarks and datasets, it might be related. The property "contain a benchmark over" could relate to how these papers use datasets for evaluation.

So, I'll select the top candidates. R284317 seems more relevant because it's more recent and discusses benchmarks explicitly. R147246 is also a candidate but with a lower score since it's older and doesn't mention TREC-6 specifically.

Finally, I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and the top candidates, ensuring the correct URIs and types are used.
