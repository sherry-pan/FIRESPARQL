Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the Sequential CIFAR-10 dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/ontology/>
     SELECT?metric
     WHERE {
    ?metric orkg:hasBenchmark "Benchmarking Models on Sequential CIFAR-10".
    ?metric orkg:hasDataset "Sequential CIFAR-10".
    ?metric rdfs:label?label.
     FILTER (lang(?label) = "en" )
     }
