Okay, I need to figure out which properties from the given JSON file are relevant for evaluating models on the Cheetah benchmark dataset. The question is about listing the metrics used, so I should look for properties related to evaluation, metrics, and benchmarks.

First, I'll scan through the properties. I see "evaluation" with the label "evaluation" and "has benchmark" with the label "has benchmark". These seem directly related because they're about assessing models and using benchmarks.

Next, there are properties like "accuracy", "recall", "macro-F1", and "micro-F1". These are common evaluation metrics, so they should be included.

I also notice "NDCG@10" which is a ranking metric, so that's relevant too. "has training set" and "validation set" might be useful because they relate to how the data is split for evaluation purposes.

"has uncertainty value" and "has uncertainty unit" could be important if the models report uncertainty in their metrics. "Avg Characters", "Avg words", "Avg Entity", etc., might provide context about the dataset's characteristics, which can influence evaluation.

"knowledge graph name" and "knowledge used" could help identify the specific benchmark or knowledge used in the evaluation. "method" is relevant because it might describe the evaluation approach.

"has classes" and "no of labels" give information about the classification tasks, which is useful for understanding the evaluation setup.

"splitting technique" and "data splitting method" explain how the data is divided, which affects evaluation. "iteration" might refer to multiple runs or iterations of the evaluation process.

"reporting level" could indicate the granularity of the evaluation results. "has training set" and "validation set" are about the data used for training and validation, which ties into the evaluation process.

"has evaluation" seems redundant since we already have "evaluation", but it's another way to express the same concept. "has dataset" is relevant because it directly relates to the dataset in question.

"has implementation" might refer to how the evaluation was implemented. "has mesh" and "has approach" are less clear but could relate to specific methods or structures used in evaluation.

"property of the dataset" and "dataset annotation type" provide more context about the dataset's properties and annotations, which can be important for evaluation.

"tabular dataset" indicates the data's structure, which might influence the evaluation metrics used. "column entity annotation" and "column type annotation" could be about how data is annotated for evaluation.

"matching strategy" and "table selection technique" might be about how data is selected or matched for evaluation. "label generation technique" is about how labels are created for evaluation.

"splitting technique" again refers to how data is split for evaluation. "lesson learned" could provide insights from the evaluation process.

"Aligned with FAIR principles" suggests the dataset follows certain standards, which is good for evaluation. "has training set" and "validation set" are already mentioned but are important for evaluation.

"has uncertainty value" and "has uncertainty unit" again relate to the precision of evaluation metrics. "classification system" is about how the model's outputs are classified, which is part of evaluation.

"Risk types" and "Types of riks" might be specific to certain evaluations, but I'm not sure. "Quantitative methods" are definitely relevant as they are used in evaluations.

"Recall", "micro-F1", "macro-F1", and "Accuracy" are all standard metrics. "has evaluation" is another way to say evaluation.

"method" is about the approach used in evaluation. "knowledge used" could refer to prior knowledge used in the evaluation process.

"has dataset" again ties back to the dataset being evaluated. "has training set" and "validation set" are about the data splits.

"has uncertainty value" and "unit" are about the metrics' precision. "classification system" is about how the model's outputs are categorized.

"Risk types" and "Types of riks" might be specific metrics or categories used. "Quantitative methods" are about the numerical evaluation.

"Recall", "micro-F1", "macro-F1", and "Accuracy" are all key metrics. "has evaluation" is again about the evaluation process.

"method" is about the evaluation approach. "knowledge used" could be about the knowledge graph used in evaluation.

"has dataset" is about the dataset being evaluated. "has training set" and "validation set" are about data splits.

"has uncertainty value" and "unit" relate to metric precision. "classification system" is about output categorization.

"Risk types" and "Types of riks" might be specific evaluation aspects. "Quantitative methods" are about numerical evaluations.

"has dataset" is about the dataset. "has training set" and "validation set" are about splits.

"has uncertainty value" and "unit" relate to precision. "classification system" is about categorization.

"Risk types" and "Types of riks" might be specific. "Quantitative methods" are about numerical evaluations.
