Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "List the metrics that are used to evaluate models on the 200k Short Texts for Humor Detection benchmark dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll start by extracting the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "metrics" and "200k Short Texts for Humor Detection benchmark dataset". The property is "evaluate models on".

Looking at the context, I see that there are two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a research method with steps, and R284316 talks about a journal article on entity knowledge extraction.

I need to find mentions of metrics or evaluation methods. In R147652, there's a step that mentions using a CRF algorithm and filtering to ensure data quality. This suggests that metrics like accuracy or F1-score might be used, but they aren't explicitly stated.

In R284316, the abstract discusses evaluating performances using different tools and datasets. It mentions using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which are common in NLP tasks. The paper also compares performances across different datasets, which implies these metrics are relevant.

Since the question is about the 200k Short Texts dataset, I'll focus on the metrics mentioned in R284316. The paper uses F1-score, accuracy, precision, and recall. These are standard metrics for classification tasks like humor detection.

I'll structure the answer by extracting "metrics" and "200k Short Texts for Humor Detection benchmark dataset" as terms. Then, I'll list the top candidates for each, ensuring they have high similarity scores based on their relevance.

I'll make sure to use the correct RDF prefixes and structure the JSON as specified, including URIs, labels, types, and scores.
