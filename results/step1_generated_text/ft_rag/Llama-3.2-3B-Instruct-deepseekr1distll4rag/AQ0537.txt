Question:
What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the Reacher, easy (DMControl100k) dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?paper?paper_lbl
WHERE {
 ?benchmark      a            orkgc:Benchmark;
                  rdfs:label   ?benchmark_lbl.
  FILTER (str(?benchmark_lbl) = "Reacher, easy (DMControl100k)")
 ?cont         orkgp:P31     ?paper.
 ?paper        rdfs:label     ?paper_lbl.
}
```    .sparql
```
    Note: The actual output JSON list is not included in this response as it is not part of the SPARQL query output. The output JSON list will be generated by the ORKG system when you run the SPARQL query.<|eot_id|>
