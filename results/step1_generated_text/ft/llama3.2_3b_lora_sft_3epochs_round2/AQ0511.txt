Question:
Give me a list of research papers along with their titles and IDs, that have performed benchmarks on the STS Benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT DISTINCT?paper?paper_lbl
     WHERE {
        ?dataset       a                orkgc:Dataset;
                        rdfs:label      ?dataset_lbl.
         FILTER (str(?dataset_lbl) = "STS Benchmark")
        ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET      ?dataset;
                        orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?cont.
        ?cont           orkgp:P31               ?paper.
        ?paper         rdfs:label              ?paper_lbl.
     }<|eot_id|>
