Question:
Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Pre-Training Dataset metric on the HMDB51 benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
    PREFIX orkg: <http://example.org/orkgc#>
    PREFIX orkp: <http://example.org/orkgp#>
    PREFIX orkr: <http://example.org/orkr#>

    SELECT?model?metric?dataset
    WHERE {
     ?model a orkg:Model.
     ?model orkp:has_value?metric.
     ?metric orkp:has_value?dataset.
     ?dataset orkr:has_hmdb51?model.
      FILTER (lang(?dataset) = "en")
    }
    ``` 
    Note: The actual SPARQL query may need to be adjusted based on the actual structure of the ORKG RDF data dump. The URIs used in the query are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual URIs of the entities and properties in the ORKG data dump. 

    The query is designed to find the model that performed best in terms of the Pre-Training Dataset metric on the HMDB51 benchmark dataset. It does this by selecting the model that has a value for the Pre-Training Dataset metric, and then filtering that model to find the one that has a value for the HMDB51 dataset. The `FILTER (lang(?dataset) = "en")` clause is used to ensure that only datasets with an English label are returned. 

    Please note that this is just one possible SPARQL query, and there may be other ways to express the same query. The actual query may need to be adjusted based on the specific structure of the ORKG data dump. 

    Also, the `SELECT?model?metric?dataset` clause is used to select the three variables that we want to retrieve from the query. The `?model` variable represents the model that performed best, the `?metric` variable represents the Pre-Training Dataset metric, and the `?dataset` variable represents the HMDB51 benchmark dataset. 

    The `WHERE` clause is used to define the conditions under which a model will be selected. In this case, the conditions are that the model must be an instance of the `orkg:Model` class, it must have a value for the `orkp:has_value` property, and that value must be a value for the `orkp:has_value` property of the `orkp:has_value` property. The `FILTER (lang(?dataset) = "en")` clause is used to filter out datasets that do not have an English label. 

    The `ORKG` prefix is used to denote the `http://example.org/orkgc#` namespace, the `ORKG` prefix is used to denote the `http://example.org/orkgp#` namespace, and the `ORKR` prefix is used to denote the `http://example.org/orkr#` namespace. These prefixes are used to denote the namespaces of the entities and properties in the ORKG data dump. 

    The actual URIs used in the query should be replaced with the actual URIs of the entities and properties in the ORKG data dump.
