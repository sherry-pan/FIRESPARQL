Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "Indicate the model that performed best in terms of Test perplexity metric on the WikiText-103 benchmark dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "model" and "WikiText-103 benchmark dataset". The property mentioned is "Test perplexity metric".

Looking through the context, I see that there are two main resources: R147652 and R284316. R147652 describes a method with several steps, and R284316 talks about a journal article on extracting entity knowledge. 

I need to find entities related to models and datasets. In the context, R147652 mentions "SVM" and "MNIST" as seed terms, but MNIST is a different dataset. R284316 discusses various tools like Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL, but these are more about NLP tools rather than models evaluated on specific datasets.

Since the question is about the WikiText-103 dataset and Test perplexity, I should look for any mentions of models evaluated on this dataset. However, in the provided context, there's no direct mention of WikiText-103 or specific models evaluated on it. The context mainly talks about NER and EL tasks, not language modeling benchmarks like WikiText.

Given that, I might have to infer or look for any related information. But since the context doesn't provide specific data about models on WikiText-103, I can't retrieve exact matches. Therefore, the candidates list would be empty because there's no relevant data in the provided context to answer the question.

The question asks for the model with the best Test perplexity on WikiText-103, but the provided context doesn't include information about this dataset or related models. Thus, no candidates can be retrieved.
