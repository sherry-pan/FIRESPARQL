Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question "What models are being evaluated on the WOS-11967 dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The main entities here are "models" and "WOS-11967 dataset". The property is "evaluated on". So, I'll note these down.

Next, I need to compute the similarity between these terms and the entities in the RDF data. Looking at the context, I see mentions of SVM, MNIST, CRF, SciBERT, and other models. The datasets mentioned include MNIST, and there's a mention of the ACL Anthology dataset in the example, but not WOS-11967. 

Since WOS-11967 isn't directly mentioned, I'll look for similar datasets. The closest I can find is the MNIST dataset, which is a well-known benchmark. For models, SVM, CRF, and SciBERT are present. 

I'll calculate the cosine similarity scores. SVM and CRF have higher scores because they're explicitly mentioned in the context. SciBERT is also there but maybe not as prominently. MNIST as a dataset would be the closest match to WOS-11967.

Now, I'll structure the JSON output. I'll include the extracted terms with their URIs and types. For the candidates, I'll list the top models and datasets with their scores. 

I need to make sure the URIs use the correct prefixes: orkgr for resources, orkgc for classes, and orkgp for properties. Also, each entry should have the rdfs:label, URI, score, type, and rdf:type.

Putting it all together, the JSON should group the results under each extracted term, showing the most relevant matches based on similarity scores.
