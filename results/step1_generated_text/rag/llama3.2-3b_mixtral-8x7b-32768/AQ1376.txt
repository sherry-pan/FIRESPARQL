Question:
Which model has achieved the highest F1 score score on the Penn Treebank benchmark dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```
    PREFIX orkgp: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontologies/orkgp#>
    PREFIX orkgr: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontologies/orkgr#>
    PREFIX orkgc: <http://www.openresearch.org/ontologies/orkgc#>
    SELECT?model?highestF1score?dataset
    WHERE {
     ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?highestF1score.
     ?highestF1score orkgr:R44252.
     ?dataset orkgp:HAS_DATASET?highestF1score.
      FILTER (bn:contains(STR(?dataset), "MPQA"))
    }
    ``` 
    Note: The provided SPARQL query is already in the format that the model should output. The model should not add any prefix declarations. 

    This prompt is based on the paper "Generating SPARQL Queries from Natural Language Questions" by Alessandro Bozzetto et al. (2021) - please let me know if you want more information about the paper or the task. 

    The task is a variant of the SPARQL query generation task, where the model needs to generate a SPARQL query based on a natural language question. The question is related to the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG), a semantic knowledge graph designed to represent, compare, and retrieve scholarly contributions. The model needs to generate a SPARQL query that can query the ORKG and get the correct answer to the input question. 

    Please let me know if you want any modifications or if you need further clarification. 

    Note: The provided answer is based on the given prompt and the provided context. The model's output may vary based on the input question and the context. 

    I hope this information helps! Let me know if you need any further assistance. 

    The final answer is:

    ```
    SELECT?model?highestF1score?dataset
    WHERE {
     ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?highestF1score.
     ?highestF1score orkgr:R44252.
     ?dataset orkgp:HAS_DATASET?highestF1score.
      FILTER (bn:contains(STR(?dataset), "MPQA"))
    }
    ```
