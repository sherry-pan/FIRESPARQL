What is the most common lead compound?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?s?o
WHERE {
 ?s a ora:Resource.
 ?s ora:hasLabel?o.
  FILTER (STR(?o) = "lead compound"^^xsd:string).
}
```    Note: The above SPARQL query is not necessarily the optimal query for the question, but it is a possible query that can be used to answer the question. The optimal query may depend on the specific structure and content of the ORKG RDF data.<|eot_id|>
