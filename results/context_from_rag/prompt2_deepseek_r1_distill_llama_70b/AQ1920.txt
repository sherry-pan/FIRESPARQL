Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the user's query using the provided context information. The query is asking for a list of papers that have utilized the Funnel Transformer model and include links to their code. 

First, I'll look through the context data to find any mentions of the Funnel Transformer model. Scanning the context, I see that there are two main resources: R147652 and R284316. 

Looking at R147652, it describes a method involving steps for named entity recognition. It doesn't mention the Funnel Transformer. 

Next, I check R284316. The description here talks about a model called jpark, which is used for improving entity annotations using background knowledge. It mentions tools like Stanford NER, DBpedia Spotlight, Flair NER, and End-to-End Neural EL. However, there's no mention of the Funnel Transformer model here either.

Since neither of the resources in the context mention the Funnel Transformer, I can conclude that there's no information available in the provided data dump that relates to the Funnel Transformer model. Therefore, the answer should indicate that no relevant papers were found in the context.
