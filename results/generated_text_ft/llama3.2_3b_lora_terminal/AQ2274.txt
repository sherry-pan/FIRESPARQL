Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the PEGASUS model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 SELECT?code
     WHERE {
      ?model       a            orkgc:Model;
                   rdfs:label      ?model_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?model_lbl) = "PEGASUS")
      ?benchmark      orkgp:HAS_DATASET       ?dataset.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK     ?benchmark.
      ?cont           orkgp:HAS_MODEL         ?model;
                       orkgp:HAS_SOURCE_CODE   ?code.
      ?code          rdfs:label              ?code_lbl.
       FILTER (str(?code_lbl) = "code reference")
     }
