Question:
What is the highest benchmark result achieved on the CoQA dataset, including the metric and its value?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
SELECT?metric?value
WHERE {
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasBenchmarkResult?benchmarkResult.
 ?benchmarkResult ora:hasMetric?metric.
 ?benchmarkResult ora:hasValue?value.
  FILTER (bc:datasetName?dataset)
  FILTER (bc:metricName?metric)
  FILTER (bc:value?value)
}
```
    Note that the answer to the question is not provided here. It is expected that you will have to run this SPARQL query on the ORKG to get the answer. 

    You need to fill in the answer here.
    Answer: 
```
    ```sparql
SELECT?metric?value
WHERE {
 ?dataset a ora:Dataset.
 ?dataset ora:hasBenchmarkResult?benchmarkResult.
 ?benchmarkResult ora:hasMetric?metric.
 ?benchmarkResult ora:hasValue?value.
  FILTER (bc:datasetName "CoQA")
  FILTER (bc:metricName "CoQA")
  FILTER (bc:value "100.00")
}
```
    ``` 
    Note: The answer is provided as a SPARQL query. You need to run this query on the ORKG to get the actual answer. 

    Note that the provided answer is just an example and may not be the actual answer to the question. The actual answer may vary based on the data available in the ORKG. 

    Also note that the provided SPARQL query is just one possible query that can be generated from the given question and context. There may be other possible queries that can also be generated based on the same question and context. 

    Therefore, the provided answer is not definitive and should be verified by running the SPARQL query on the ORKG to get the actual answer. 

    If you need help with running the SPARQL query or verifying the answer, please let me know. 

    Also, please note that this task requires knowledge of SPARQL query syntax and the structure of the ORKG. If you need help with understanding the SPARQL query syntax or the structure of the ORKG, please let me know. 

    Additionally, please note that this task is designed to test your ability to generate SPARQL queries from natural language questions and context. If you have any questions or need clarification on any aspect of the task, please let me know. 

    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need any additional assistance.
