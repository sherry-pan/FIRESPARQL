Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the question: "What are the titles and IDs of research papers that include a benchmark for the PubMed 20k RCT dataset?" using the provided ORKG RDF data dump.

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "research papers" and "PubMed 20k RCT dataset". The properties involved are "include a benchmark for".

Looking at the context, I see two main resources: R147246 and R284317. Both are research papers with details like authors, venues, and years.

For "PubMed 20k RCT dataset", I don't see it explicitly mentioned in the context. However, I can look for related datasets or mentions. Since it's not present, I might have to consider that the context doesn't cover this specific dataset.

Next, I'll compute similarity. Since "PubMed 20k RCT" isn't in the data, I'll look for any mentions of PubMed or similar datasets. The context doesn't have that, so I'll focus on the papers present.

The papers in the context are R147246 and R284317. R147246 is from 2015 with authors Ligia Sierra and others, and R284317 is from 2021 with authors Rajesh Bhatia and Amit Gupta.

I'll consider these as the top candidates since they are the only papers in the data. Their titles aren't provided, but I can infer based on their content. R147246 seems to be about entity recognition, and R284317 discusses knowledge extraction.

So, I'll structure the answer with these two papers as the top candidates, even though they might not directly mention the PubMed dataset. Their relevance is based on their focus on NLP tasks, which might relate to benchmarks.
