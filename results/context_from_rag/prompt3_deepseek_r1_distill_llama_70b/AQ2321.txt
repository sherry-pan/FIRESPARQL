Okay, I need to figure out how to answer the query using the provided context. The question is asking to list the code links in papers that use the FQF model in any benchmark. 

First, I'll extract the relevant terms from the question. The key entities here are "FQF model" and "code links." The property mentioned is "use" as in papers that use the model.

Looking at the context, I see that there are several resources and predicates. For example, R147652 describes a method with several steps, and R283709 and R283710 are about papers with authors and publication details. 

I need to find entities related to the FQF model. In the context, I don't see any direct mention of FQF, so I'll have to look for similar models or related terms. The closest I can find are resources like R147652, which is about a method, and R283709, which is a journal article. 

For code links, I'm looking for predicates that relate to code or implementations. In the context, I don't see specific terms for code links, but maybe "HAS_VALUE" or other predicates could be relevant. 

I'll map these extracted terms to the available resources and predicates. Since FQF isn't present, I'll consider similar models or methods. The code links might be linked via predicates like P5044 or P41924, but I'm not sure. 

I'll structure the JSON output with the extracted terms and the candidates. Each candidate will have a URI, label, and type. Since the exact matches aren't there, I'll use the available resources and predicates as placeholders.

I need to ensure that the URIs use the correct prefixes and that the types are accurate. I'll include the relevant classes like "orkgc:Resource" and "orkgp:Predicate" where applicable.

Finally, I'll make sure the JSON is properly formatted and includes all the necessary sections as per the example provided.
