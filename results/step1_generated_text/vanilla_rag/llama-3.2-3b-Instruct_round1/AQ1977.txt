Question:
Where can I find code references in papers that have used the STREET model for benchmarking purposes?

Generated SPARQL:
 PREFIX orkg: <http://orkg.org/orkg/>
     SELECT?paper?code
     WHERE {
    ?paper a orkg:Paper.
    ?paper orkg:has_benchmark?benchmark.
    ?benchmark orkg:has_method "STREET".
    ?benchmark orkg:has_implementation?code.
     }<|eot_id|>
