Question:
What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the SciGEN dataset?

Generated SPARQL:
 ```sparql
PREFIX orkgp: <http://example.org/orkgp/>
PREFIX orkgr: <http://example.org/orkgr/>
SELECT?metric?metricLabel?model?modelLabel
WHERE {
 ?model orkgp:HAS_MODEL?modelLabel.
 ?model orkgp:HAS_METRIC?metric.
 ?metric orkgp:HAS_LABEL?metricLabel.
 ?metric orkgp:HAS_BENCHMARK?benchmark.
 ?benchmark orkgr:R122689.
 ?metric orkgr:R122689.
}
```sparql

Note: The actual SPARQL query should be generated based on the provided input question and context. The provided query is just a sample query that might not be correct. 

The goal is to generate a correct SPARQL query based on the input question and the provided context. The correct SPARQL query should be able to retrieve the correct evaluation metrics, benchmarking methods, models, and the SciGEN dataset from the Open Research Knowledge Graph (ORKG). 

The query should be able to link the correct entities and properties from the context to the entities and properties in the ORKG. 

The query should be able to answer the input question correctly and retrieve the correct information from the ORKG. 

The provided context includes the following information:

1. The question itself, which is "What evaluation metrics are commonly used when benchmarking models on the SciGEN dataset?"
2. The extracted terms from the question, which are "evaluation metrics", "benchmarking", "models", and "SciGEN dataset".
3. The candidate entities and properties in the ORKG that can be linked to the entities and properties mentioned in the question.

The correct SPARQL query should be able to link the extracted terms to the candidate entities and properties in the ORKG and retrieve the correct information. 

The correct SPARQL query should be able to answer the input question correctly and retrieve the correct evaluation metrics, benchmarking methods, models, and the SciGEN dataset from the ORKG. 

The query should be able to use the correct predicates and resources from the ORKG to retrieve the correct information. 

The correct SPARQL query should be able to use the context information to link the correct entities and properties in the ORKG and retrieve the correct information.
